		- ### Demographics
			- Age: 5-12 years
			- Uncommon before 3 years
	- ### Geographic Distribution
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- After infection y group A beta haemolytic streptococci, antibody produced against the streptococcal antigens.
		- Antigen-antibody complexes are thus formed in the blood, deposited in the glomeruli, where they incite glomerular inflammation and activate the complement cascade.
		- As a result of this inflammation, the following clinico-pathological events occur
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- ((67384d80-0fa9-407a-bf72-a40fed3e85c6))
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Signs and Symptoms
		- #### Symptoms
			- History of skin or throat infection: May be present, 1-6 weeks prior to disease manifestations.
			- Variable manifestations related to severity of renal involvement ranging from
				- Asymptomatic microscopic haematuria with normal renal function to acute kidney injury (AKI)
			- Scanty high coloured urine, may have anuria
			- Puffiness of face
			- Fever: Uncommon, but may have low grade fever
			- Non-specific symptoms : malaise, lethargy, headache or vomiting may be present
			- Sometimes, patients may present with features of comolications like
				- ((67384e8c-b398-4d12-99be-78ae8deece2d))
		- #### Signs
			- Periorbital swelling, and of face also
			- Pallor : Mild
			- Skin : Evidence of [[Scabies]] or Scars of previous infected scabies
			- Oedema : Present
			- Blood Pressure : High
			- Features of [[Left Heart Failure]]
	- ### Stages or Classification
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Based on typical C/F and supportive laboratory findings.
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Diagnosis
		- #### Classical Presentation
			- Evidence of Edema with History of Sore Throat examination
			- Associated with scabies
			- High Blood Pressure
			- Features of [[Left Heart Failure]], [[Hypertensive Encephalopathy]], [[Renal Failure]]
		- #### Probable Diagnosis
	- ### Laboratory Tests
		- ((67385fe9-5fab-4115-843c-17cd3c424e76))
	- ### Imaging Studies
		- ((67385ffd-3281-4b85-86ec-8a36c9df2689))
	- ### Differential Diagnosis
	- ### Confirmation of Diagnosis
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Counselling
		- Counsel parents about the nature of the disaese, its complications, treatment and prognosis
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Bed Rest
		- Diet : Restriction of
			- Protein to 0.5 gm/kg/day
			- Salt : No added salt in the diet
			- Potassium ($$\ce{K+}$$) & $$\ce{K+}$$ rich food and fruits
			- Fluid : 400 $$ml/m^2$$ + Output of previous day
		- Diuretics : Frusemide (1-2 mg/kg/day)
		- Antibiotics
			- Oral Phenoxymethyl Penicillin (50 mg/kg/day) in 4 divided doses for 10 days
				- >Penicillin does not alter the course of the disease but it prevents spreading of remaining nephritogenic strain of sreptococcus to the contacts
		- Antihypertensives
			- For rapid reduction of BP
				- Nifedipine (0.3-0.5 mg/kg) sublingual
			- For maintenance of normal BP
				- Captopril (0.25-6 mg/kg/day) in 2-4 doses
				- Nifedipine (0.25-0.5 mg/kg/day) in 2-4 doses

	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
	- ### Follow-up
		- Daily to assess clinical response and to search for any complications
