- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- [[Leiomyoma]]s are the most common benign tumors of the uterus and also the most common benign solid tumor in female
		- hospital outpatient : 3%
	- ### Prevalence
		- 20% women at age 30
			- 50% of these remain asymptomatic
		- high between 35 and 45 years
		- ### Demographics
	- ### Para Distribution
		- more common in [[nulliparous]] or those having one child infertility
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- arises from the neoplastic single smooth muscle of the myometrium
		- Each myomama is monoclona
		- The stimulus for initial neoplastic myocyte transformation is not known
		- Initial Sitmulus is unknown but following are implicated
			- #### Chromosomal abnormality
				- 40% of cases, there is a varying type of chromosomal abnormality particularly the chromosome seven (17%) or twelve (12%) (rearrangements, deletions)
			- #### Role of polypeptide growth factors
				- Epidermal growth factor (EFG)
				- Insuline-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
				- Transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß)
				- these stimulate the growth of leiomyoma either directly or via estrogen.
	- ### Growth of Leiomyomas
		- Both estrogen and progesterone receptors are found in higher concentrations in myomas.
		- Myomas cells have higher levels of the enzyme [[aromatase]]. This increases the high local levels of estrogen.
		- Are rare before menarche and majority decreases in size following menopause.
		- They often enlarge during pregnancy.
		- Hypoestrogenic conditions (GnRH agonist use) reduces the size of myomas.
		- Hypercellularity of myomas (cellular leiomyomotas) are less common (<5%). Cellular myomas are often larger in size. Clinical presentation is more close to a sarcoma(leiomyosarcoma).
		- However, most cellular leiomyomata have a benign course and prognosis.
		- Myoma cell contains more estrogen receptors than the adjacent myometrium.
		- Frequent association of anovulation.
