	- ### Medical Treatment
		- [[Insulin]]
			- Indication
				- plasma glucose level exceeds 90 mg% and 2 hours postprandial value is greater than 120 mg% (repetitive) even on diet control
				- Nearly 25% women with GDM need insulin therapy
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- #### Diet
			- 2000-2500 Kcal/day for normal weight woman and restriction to 1200-1800 Kcal/day for overweight woman is recommended.
			- Carbohydrate should be 40-50% of total calories.
			- Commplex Carbohydrate
		- Excercie
			- Aerobic
			- Brisk Walking
			- may obviate the need of insulin therapy
		- Monitoring
			- Women should perform self-blood glucose monitoring using reflectance meter.
	- ### Obstetric Management
		- #### Time of Termination of Pregnancy #obspc
			- Women with good glycemic control and who do not require insulin may wait for spontaneous onset of labor. However, elective delivery (induction or cesarean section) is considered in patients requiring insulin or with complications (macrosomia) at around 38 weeks
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Follow-up
				- The patient needs more frequent antenatal supervision with periodic checkup of fasting plasma glucose level which should be less than 90 mg%.
			- Maintenance of mean plasma glucose level between 105 mg% and 110 mg% is desirable for good fetal outcome
