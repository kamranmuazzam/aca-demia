alias:: Intra-Uterine Fetal Growth Retardation

- #definition IUFGR is said to be present in those babies whose birth wegiht is below the 10th percentile of the average for the gestational age #obspc
- # Difference between symmetrical & asymmetrical IUFGR #obspc
	- |Symmetric IUFGR|Asymmetrical IUFGR|
	  |--|--|
	  |Uniformly small|Head larger than abdomen|
	  |Ponderal index (Birth weight/Crown-heel length) - normal|Low|
	  |HC : AC and[:br]FL : AC ratios - normal|Elevated|
	  |Etiology : Genetic disease or infection - (Intrinsic to fetus)|Chronic placental insufficiency - (Extrinsic to fetus)|
	  |Total cell number - less[:br]Cell size - normal|Normal[:br]Smaller|
	  |Neonatal course - complicated with poor prognosis|Usually uncomplicated having good prognosis|
- # Complications #obspc
	- Fetal
		- Antenatal
			- Chronic fetal distress, fetal death
		- Intranatal
			- Hypoxia
			- Acidosis
		- Postnatal
			- Immediate
				- Asphyxia, Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and RDS
				- Hypoglycemia due to shortage of glycogen reserve in the liver
				- Meconium aspiration syndrome
				- Microcoagulation leading to DIC
				- Hypothermia
				- Pulmonary hemorrhage
				- Polycythemia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
				- Hyper viscosity-thrombosis
				- Necrotizing enterocolitis due to reduced intestinal blood flow
				- Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)
				- Electrolyte abnormalities
					- Hypocalcemia
					- Hyperphosphatemia
					- Hypokalemia
				- Multiorgan failure
				- Increased perinatal morbidity and mortality
			- Late
				- Retarded neurological and intellectual development infancy
				- Increased risk of metabolic syndrome in adult life
					- Obesity
					- Hypertension
					- Diabetes
					- Coronary Heart Disease
				- LBW infants have an altered orexigenic mechanism that causes increased appetite and reduced satiety
				- Reduced number of nephrons - causes renal vascular hypertension
