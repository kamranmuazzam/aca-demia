alias:: Kidney Stones, Nephrolithiasis, Urolithiasis
ICD-11_Code:: GB60
tags:: disease, nephrology, urology

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Calcium oxalate (most common)
		- Uric acid
		- Struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate)
		- Cystine
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Dehydration
		- High sodium diet
		- Obesity
		- Family history
		- Certain medications (e.g., diuretics, calcium supplements)
		- Metabolic disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, gout)
		- Ectopic Kidney (incidence doubles,  increases from 10% to 20%)
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- ~10% of people will have a kidney stone in their lifetime
	- ### Prevalence
		- Higher in developed countries
		- ### Demographics
			- More common in males (3:1 male-to-female ratio)
			- Peak incidence at 30-50 years
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Higher prevalence in hot, arid climates ("Stone Belt" in the southeastern US)
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Supersaturation of urine with stone-forming compounds
		- Crystal nucleation, growth, and aggregation
		- Impaired inhibitors of stone formation (e.g., citrate)
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Kidneys
		- Ureters
		- Bladder
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Severe flank pain (renal colic)
			- Hematuria
			- Nausea/vomiting
			- Dysuria
		- #### Signs
			- Costovertebral angle tenderness
			- Restlessness (due to pain)
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- By location: renal calyx, pelvis, ureter, bladder
		- By composition: calcium, uric acid, struvite, cystine
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical presentation + imaging confirmation
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- **First-line:** Non-contrast CT (NCCT) (gold standard, >95% sensitivity)
			- **Alternative options:**
				- Ultrasound (for pregnant women/children, but misses small stones)
				- X-ray (KUB) (limited sensitivity; useful for follow-up of known radiopaque stones)
			- Urinalysis (hematuria, crystals, pH clues)
				- | **Parameter** | **Expected Findings** | **Clinical Significance** |
				  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
				  | **Hematuria** | Microscopic or gross hematuria (~85% of cases) | Suggests irritation/obstruction by stone |
				  | **Crystals** | - **Calcium oxalate** (envelope-shaped) <br />- **Uric acid** (rhomboid/rosettes) <br />- **Cystine** (hexagonal) <br />- **Struvite** (coffin-lid) | Clues to stone composition |
				  | **pH** | - **Low pH (<5.5)**: Uric acid stones  <br />- **High pH (>7.2)**: Struvite stones (UTI-related) | Guides dietary/medical therapy |
				  | **Nitrites/WBCs** | Positive if concurrent UTI (common with struvite) | Indicates infection risk |
			- | **Modality** | **Sensitivity** | **Specificity** | **Best For** |
			  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
			  | **X-ray (KUB)** | ~60-70% | Moderate | Tracking known radiopaque stones |
			  | **Ultrasound** | ~45-60% | High | Pregnant women, children, hydronephrosis detection |
			  | **Non-contrast CT (NCCT)** | **>95%** (gold standard) | Very high | Initial diagnosis, small/radiolucent stones |
			  | **IVP (Intravenous Pyelogram)** | ~70-80% | Moderate | Historical use (largely replaced by CT) |
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- | **Differential Diagnosis** | **Shared Features** | **Clinical Exclusion** | **Baseline Workup** (Perform even if no suspicion) | **Direct Testing** (Perform if suspicion) |
			  |---|---|---|---|---|
			  | Pyelonephritis | Flank pain, fever | Fever, positive urine culture | Urinalysis, CBC | Urine culture |
			  | Appendicitis | Abdominal pain | RLQ pain, rebound tenderness | CBC, CRP | Abdominal CT |
			  | AAA | Severe abdominal/flank pain | Pulsatile abdominal mass | Ultrasound | CT angiography |
		- ### General Assessment
			- Serum electrolytes, calcium, uric acid
			- 24-hour urine collection (for recurrent stones)
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- NSAIDs for pain
		- Alpha-blockers (for ureteral stones)
		  *less than 10 mm*
		- Hydration
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
		- Ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy
		- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL)
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Increase fluid intake (>2L/day)
		- Reduce sodium intake
		- Moderate protein intake
	- ### Follow-up
		- Repeat imaging if stone not passed
		- Metabolic workup for recurrent stones
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Surgical treatments >90% successful
		- #### Without Treatment
			- Most stones <5mm pass spontaneously (80%)
				- | **Stone Size** | **Spontaneous Passage Rate (Without MET)** | **With Tamsulosin (MET)** |
				  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
				  | **≤5 mm** | ~68-80% | **~80-90%** (faster passage, reduced pain) |
				  | **5-7 mm** | ~50-60% | **~70-80%** (improved by ~20-30%) |
				  | **7-10 mm** | ~20-30% | **~40-60%** (still often needs intervention) |
				  | **>10 mm** | <10% | **<20%** (usually requires surgery) |
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Obstruction
				- Infection (pyelonephritis, sepsis)
				- Renal damage
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Recurrent stones (50% within 10 years)
