	  MIST
		- Mechanism of Injury
		- Injuries
		- Signs/Symptoms
		- Treatment Recieved
	- ECG
	- Urinary Catheter
	- Gastric Catheter
	- Monitoring
		- ABG
		- Pulse oximeter
		- Blood Pressure
	- X-Rays
		- AP CXR
		  note: `The Survery Department in BIRDEM has a misconception that CXR are always PA`
		- AP Pelvis
		- C-spine
	- Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage
	- Abdominal Ultrasonography(FAST)
	  in presence of FAST, Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage is obsolete

- # Secondary Survery
  id:: 67b8b06f-1b6d-4d6f-bb99-d442657c6226
	- The secondary survey does not begin until
		- the primary survery is completed
		- resuscitation efforts are well establised
		- The patient is demonstrating normalization of vital functions
	- Head to Toe evaluation
	- Complete history and Physical Examination
	- Reassessment of all Vital Signs
	- Complete Neurological Examination
	- Indicated X-Rays are obtained
	- Specific procedures
	- Tubes and fingers in every orifice
	- ## History
	  AMPLE
		- Allergies
		- Medications
		- Past Illness
		- Last meal
		- Events/Environment related to injury
			- Blunt trauma - Direction and speed of impact
			- Penetrating Trauma
			- Thermal Injury
			- Exposure to chemicals/radiation and toxins
	- ## Pitfalls
		- Facial edema in patients with massive facial injury or patients in coma can preclude a complete eye examination
		- Blunt injury to the neck may produce injuries in which clinical signs and symptoms develop late(e.g. Injury to the intima of the carotid artery)
		- The identification of cervical nerve root/brachial plexus injury may not be possible in the comatose patient
		- Decubitus ulcer from immobilization on a rigid spine board/cervical collar
		- Children often sustain significant injury to the intrathoracic structures without evidence of thoracic skeletal trauma
		- A normal initial examination of the abdomen does not exclude a significant antraabdominal injury
		- Patients with impaired sensorium secondary to alcohol/drugs are at risk
		- Injury to the retroperitoneal organs may be difficult to identify
		- Female urethral injury is difficult to detect
		- Blood loss from pelvic fractures can be difficult to control and fatal hemorrhage may result(use pelvic binder to temporarily control the hemorrhage or embolization)
		- Fractures involving the bones of extremities are often not diagnosed.
		- Most of the diagnostic and therapeutic maneuvers increase ICP
- # Adjunts to the Secondary Survery
  These specialized tests should not be performed until the patient's hemodynamic status has been normalized and the patient has been carefully examined
	- Additional X-Rays of the spine and extremities
	- CT of the head, chest, abdomen and spine
	- Contrast urography
	- Angiography
	- Bronchoscopy
	- Esophagoscopy
- # Revaluation
  id:: 67b8b29f-a1d6-464f-bc3a-4a039c45c324
	- The trauma patient must be reevaluated constantly to assure that new findings are not overlooked
	- A high index of suspicion
	- Continuous monitoring of vital signs and urinary output is essential
	- ABG/cardiac monitoring/ pulse oximetry
	- Pain relive-IV opiates/Anxiolytics
- # Definitive Treatment
  id:: 67b8b08b-3a59-44e5-a03d-713aedbee424
	- Transfer to a trauma center or closest appropriate hospital
