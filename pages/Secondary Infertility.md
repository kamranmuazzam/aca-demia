- # Investigation #gyn-prof-card
	- ## Routine Investigations
		- TC, DC, ESR, Hb%, Xray chest, mantaoux test to exclude tuberculosis
		- Blood sugar estimation to exclude diabetes
		- Urine analysis
	- ## Special Investigations
		- To see evidence of ovulation
			- Basal body temperature
			- Cervical mucus test
			- Estimation of serum progesterone
			- Serial estimation of LH hormone
			- Endometrial biopsy
			- Sonographic evidence of enlargement of the follicles & its rupture. Mature follicle is 18-24 mm in diameter
			- Laproscopic visualization of corpus luteum
		- To see tubal pathology
			- Hysterosalpingography
			- Laparoscopic dye test
			- Tubal insufflation test
		- To see the uterine pathology
			- Hysterosalpingography
			- Hysteroscopy
		- To see the cervical pathology
