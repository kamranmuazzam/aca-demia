	- ### Diagnostic Criteria

		- X-Ray Abodomen PA View
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Transverse Lies Stone
		- USG whole abdomen with special focus to HepatoBiliary Pancreaticoduodenal system
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number

	- ### Investigation
	- ### Confirmation of Diagnosis
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Treat the Pain -> Opiod Analgesics
			- Step Up if Not Resolving and Increasing in Severity
			- Step Down if Resolving
				- [[NSAIDS]] (as it is a chronic chase) #shaheen
		- Multidisciplinary care (GI, pain, nutrition, behavioral health)
			- Treat the Addiction -> Alcoholism/Smoking Cessation
			- Treat the Malnutrition -> Pancreatic Enzymes, Fat Soluble Vitamins
			- Treat the Diabetes -> [[Insulin]]
	- ### Pain Management in Chronic Pancreatitis
		- Analgesic Ladder
			- First line : scheduled [[Paracetamol]] ± [[NSAIDS]] if safe
			- Add neuropathic/central modulators (often needed)
				- [[Pregabalin]] 25-75 mg qHS, titrate to 150-300 mg BID(renal adjust), or
				- [[Gabapentin]] 100-300 mg TID, titrate to effect (renal adjust)
				- Consider a TCA ([[Amitriptyline]]/ [[Nortriptyline]] 10-25 mg qHS) or an SNRI ([[Duloxetine]] 30-60 mg daily) if tolerated. [[SSRIs]] are less effective for analgesia
			- [[Tramadol]] can be used for moderate pain or as a bridge
			- Reserve stronger opiods for refractory cases at the lowest effective dose, with clear goals and reassessment; avoid long-term high-dose therapy
			- If any opiods are still needed, give only a very short course with clear stop date and a laxative
		- Refractory pain despite meds: discuss endoscopic/surgical options for structural disease and consider EUS-guided celiac plexus block/neurolysis; involve [[Anæsthesia]]
	- ### Surgery
		- #### Indications of Surgery
			- Failure of Medical Treatment
			- If Acute Exagerbation of Pain requires hospitalization > 2 attacks a year for ≥ 2 consecutive years
			- Severe Pain that Hamper day to day life
		- #### Surgical Options
			- |Surgical Option|Condition|
			  |--|--|
			  |Lateral Pancreatico jejunoestomy|Stone in Dilated Pancreatic Duct|
			  |Distal Pancreatectomy|if stone/calcification in tail of pancreas|
			  |Whipple's Operation|if stone/calcification in head of pancreas|
			  |Total pancreatectomy|if entire pancreas involve|
