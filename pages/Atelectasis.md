- # Classification
	- Primary Atelectasis
	- Secondary Atelectasis
- # Resorption Atelectasis
	- Pathophyiology
		- Occurs when an obstruction prevents air from reaching distal airways
		- the air already present in the alveoli is gradually absorbed into the bloodstream
		- leading to alveolar collapse
	- Common Causes
		- Obstruction of a bronchus by mucus plugs (postoperative patients, asthma, cystic fibrosis)
		- Aspiration of foreign bodies
		- Tumors compressing or obstructing airways
		- Enlarged lymph nodes (tuberculosis or lymphoma)
- # Compression Atelectasis
	- Pathophysiology
		- external pressure on the lung
		- Prevention of Full Expansion of Lungs
	- Common Causes
		- Pleural Effusion
		- Pneumothorax
		- Large Intrathoracic tumors
		- Elevated Diaphragms
- # Contraction Atelectasis
	- Pathophysiology
		- Fibrosis or Scarring in the Lung or Pleura
		- Prevention of Full Expansion of Lungs
	- Common Causes
		- Chronic Inflammation
		  *[[Tuberculosis]]*
		- Radiation-induced fibrosis
		- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- # Microatelectasis
	- Etymology
	  micro
		- on gross appearance(macroscopically) here, the Lungs appear normal
	- Pathophysiology
		- Collapse of very small areas of Lung due to inadequate ventilation or surfactant deficiency
	- Common Cause
		- Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
		- Neonatal Respiratory Distress Syndrome
		- Prolonged shallow breathing
			- in postoperative patients
			- patients in mechanical ventilation
