	- **Basic Techniques**:

	- **Advanced Techniques**:
		- Endotracheal intubation (gold standard).
		- Supraglottic airway devices (e.g., Laryngeal Mask Airway - LMA).
	- **Difficult Airway Management**:
		- Use of video laryngoscopy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, or surgical airway (cricothyroidotomy) if needed.

			- Blood Urea
			- Serum creatinine
		- Urine Routine Microscopic Examination

		- Atelectasis
		- Hypoxia
		- Pneumonia
	- Pain and Sore Throat

- # Preparation of Diabetes Patient for Major Surgery
	- History
		- Type of Diabetes
		- Duration
		- Drug History
		- History of Complications
	- Access and Improve Glycemic Control
		- Target
			- HbA1c : <8%
			- Fasting Blood Glucose : <7.7 mmol/L
			- Post Prandial Blood Glucose
		- Adjust Medications
			- Insulin
				- Type 1 DM : Continue basal insulin
				  *prevent ketoacidosis*
				- Type 2 DM : Adjust or Reduce Basal Insulin on Fasting Glucose Levels
			- Oral Hypoglycemics
				- Stop SGLT2 inhibitors 3-4 days before surgery
				  *prevent euglycemic DKA*
				- Stop metformin 24-48 hours before surgery
				  *prevent lactic acidosis*
				- Adjust or stop sulfonylureas
				  *avoid hypoglycemia*
			- Non-Insulin Injectables
				- Adjust GLP-1 receptor agonists based on half-life and risk of delayed gastric emptying
	- Investigation
		- Biochemistry
			- Glycemic Control
				- HbA1c
				- Fasting Blood Glucose
			- Renal Function Test
				- Creatinine
				- eGFR
			- Electrolytes
		- Cardiac Evaluation : ECG
		- Urine RME
		  *to rule out UTI*
		- Nutritional Assessment
	- Perioperative Management
		- Day Before Surgery
			- Adjust Insulin based on Glucose
			- Ensure Patient understands Fasting Guidelines (NPO after midnight)
		- Day of Surgery
			- Check Fasting Blood Glucose on arrival
			- Insulin Management
				- Type 1 DM : Administer 50-100% of basal insulin dose
				- Type 2 DM : Reduce or withhold insulin/oral agents based on glucose levels
			- Intraoperative Monitoring
				- Monitor Blood Glucose every 1-2 hours during surgery
				- Use intravenous insulin infusion for tight glycemic control if needed
				  *Target : 7.7-10 mmol/L*
		- Post Operative Management
			- Continue frequent glucose monitoring (every 2-4 hours)
			- Restart oral hypoglycemics or insulin once the patient is eating
			- Avoid sliding-scale insulin alone; use basal-bolus regimens for better control
	- Special Considerations
		- Infection Prevention
			- Strict aseptic techniques
			- Consider prophylactic antibiotics if indicated
		- Wound Healing
			- Optimize Nutrition (protein, Vitamin C and D, Zinc)
			- Tight glycemic control to promote healing
		- Cardiovascular Risk
			- Monitor for perioperative myocardial ischemia or arrhythmias
		- Fluid Management
			- Avoid dehydration or overhydration, especially if patients with renal impairment
	- Multidisciplinary Approach
		- Involve endocrinologists, anestheisologists, surgeons and diabetes educators
		- Educate the patient on the importance of glycemic control and self-monitoring
	- Emergency Situations
		- Diabetic Ketoacidosis
			- Suspect in Type 1 DM or poorly controlled Type 2 DM
			- Treat with IV fluids, insulin, and electrolyte correction
		- Hypoglycemia
			- Treat with IV dextrose or oral glucose if the patient is awake
- # Precautions in Children before General Anesthesia
	- Preoperative Assessment
		- Thorough History and Physical Examination to Identify any underlying medical conditions
			- Bleeding Disorders
			- Allergies
			- Respiratory Issues
		- Check Family History of adverse reactions to anesthesia
	- Fasting Guidelines
		- Ensure the child follows fasting guidelines to prevent aspiration
			- Clear fluids: 2 hours before anesthesia
			- Breast milk: 4 hours before anesthesia
			- Solid food: 6-8 hours before anesthesia
	- Informed Consent
		- From Parents
	- ## Prevention of Tongue Fallback in Postoperative Period
		- Proper positioning
			- Place the child in the recovery position (lateral decubitus position) to allow the tongue to fall forward and secretions to drain
			- Avoid supine positioning until the child is fully awake
		- Airway Management
			- Use an oropharyngeal airway if necessary to maintain patency
			- Monitor oxygen saturation
		- Close Monitoring
			- Observe the child in the recovery room until fully awake and able to maintain their airway independently
			- Ensure trained staff are present to manage any airway emergencies
		- Avoid Over Sedation
			- Use the minimum effective dose of sedatives and opiods to reduce the risk of respiratory depression
		- Stimulation
			- Gently stimulate the child if there are signs of airway obstruction
			  *snoring or desaturation*
