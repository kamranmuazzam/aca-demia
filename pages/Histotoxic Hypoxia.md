- #definition Although oxygen reaching the cells is normal but cells are unable to use the oxygen effectively
- Causes
	- Disabled oxidative phosphorylation enzymes | cytochrome oxidase
		- by cyanide poisoning
	- Inhibition of Tissue Oxidative Process
- Treatment
	- No benefit in $$\ce{O2}$$ therapy
	- Methyl blue/ Nitrates used in CN poisoning
		- Mechanism of Action
			- form methemoglobin
			- reacts with CN to form cyanmethemoglobin
			  *a non toxic compound*
			- the administered amount is limited to the amount of methemoglobin can be safely formed
