- [[Benign Murmers]]
- Never normal =
	- Anything DIASTOLIC
	- Anything > II/VI
	- Get an echo
- Newborn is cynanotic @ birth, O2 does not improve. -- Transposition of the Freat Arteries
	- Most common in? Infants of diabetic mothers
	- Assocaited murmur? NONE! (unless PDA or VSD)
	- Immedaite tx? PGE1 to keep PDA patent
- 2 y/o child who gets cyanotic and hypernea while plaing, squats down
	- Tetralogy of Fallot
		- Pulmonary Stenosis
		- RA hypertorphy
		- Over riding aorta
		- VSD
	- Assocaited murumr? Harsh SEM + Single S2
	- Treatment? O2 and knee-chest position, surgical correction
- Bipolar woman gives birth to a child w/ holosystolic murmur worse on inspiration.
	- Ebstein Anomaly - Tricuspid insuficciency 2/2 TV displacement into RV
	- Associated arrhythmia? Wolff parkinson White
- Cyanosis @ birth with holosystolic murmur, depends on VSD or ASD for life. EKG shows LVH -- Triscuspid atresia, Give PGE1 until surgery
- Heart defect assocaited with DiGeorge syndrome. CXR shows ↑ puml blood flow and bi-ventricular hypertrophy -- Truncus arteriosis. Eisenmenger develops early. Do surg in 1st few weeks of life
- -#1 congenital heart lesion. Harsh holosystolic murmur over LL sternal border, loud P2 -- Ventriculoseptal defect
	- If II/VI in a 2 mo old? If no sxs, continue to monitor. Most close by 1-2 year
	- Gold standard dx test? Echo
	- When is surgery indicated? FTT, -6 12 mo w/ HTN, > 2 years w/ Qp/Qs > 2:1
	- Is louder better or worse? Better. It means the defect is small. Most often membranous. More likely to spontaneously close
- Loud S1 w/ fixked and split S2. Older child w/ exercise intolerance. -- ASD
- Most common defect in Down Syndrome baby. Fixed & split S2 + SEM w/ diastolic rumble -- Endocardial Cushion Defect
	- Tx? @ risk for early Eisenmengers. Surgery before pHTN @ 6-12 mo
- Continuous machine-like murur w/bounding pulses and wide pulse pressure -- PDA
	- Associations? -- Prematurity, congenital rubella syndrome
	- Treatment? If not closed by 1 wk, give indomethacin or surgically close
- Most common defect in Turner's baby. Decreased femoral pulses, "reverse 3 sign", "notching" @ inf rib border 2/2 incr collateral. May see asymmetry in arm BPs
- Other cardiac diseases
	- 15 year old athlete complains of occasional palpations agnina and dizziness. Last week he fainted during the 1st inning of his baseball game. -- HOCM
		- Murmur? SEM, better w/ ↑ preload (squat, handgrip) louder w/ valsalva, standing, exercise (↓preload)
		- Treatment of this child? Beta blocker or CCB (no diuretics or dig- wy?)
			- Alcohol ablation or surgical myotomy
		- Restriction? No sports or heavy exercise!
	- 7 year old girl presents vauge chest pain, pain in several different joints over the past few days, and a rash. Her ESR is elevated, and her EKG shows prolongation of PR interval. -- Acute Rheumatic Fever
		- Treatment? Oral PCN (erythromycin) for 10 days, then prophylactic till 20
			- Complications? Mitral stenosis, (then aortic or tricuspid involvement)
