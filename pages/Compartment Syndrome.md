alias:: Acute Compartment Syndrome, Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome
ICD-11_Code:: FB84.0 (Acute Compartment Syndrome), FB84.1 (Chronic Compartment Syndrome)
tags:: disease , trauma induced disease, orthopedics

- #definition {{c1 In a closed myofascial comprartment, increase of compartment pressure due to any pathology, causes reduction of capillary perfusion, leading to ischemia and tissue necrosis... this is called compartment sydrome }} #ortho-prof-card
- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Extrinsic Cause
			- Tight Bandage / Tight Plaster (even if the feet swelling will cause Tight Plaster)
			- Burn Scar (constrictive scars)
		- Intrinsic Cause
			- Injury, Trauma/ Fracture(most common) -> hematoma
			- Vascular Injury/ Reperfusion Injury
			- Bleeding Disorders (Hemophilia, anticoagulants) -> Hematoma
			- Infection (Abscess, Necrotizing Fasciitis)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Tibial Fractures (most common cause)
		- Crush Injuries
		- Prolonged Limb compression
		- Vigorous exercise (Chronic Exertional Compartment Syndrome)
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- ~3.1 per 100,000 anually (higher in trauma patients)
	- ### Prevalence
		- ### Demographics
			- Young males (trauma-related)
			- Athletes (chronic exertional form)
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- No significant variation
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Increased intracompartmental pressure-> vessels are compressed → capillary perfusion ↓ → ischemia → muscle/nerve necrosis → irreversible damage if untreated.
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Muscles (necrosis -> rhabdomyolysis)
		- Nerves (Paresthesia -> Paralysis)
- ## Clinical Features #ortho-prof-card
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Severe pain(disproportionate to injury)
			- Parasthenia
			- Weakness
		- Signs
			- 5 Ps(late sign), Pain, Pallor, Paresthesia, paralysis, Pulselessness
			  *Pain out of propotion*
			- Passive stretching test : Severe pain on passive muscle stretching
			  *Severe pain on movement*
			- Tense, swollen compartment
		- ### Cardinal Features
			- Inproportionate pain due to injury (more pain than injury apparantly)
			- Passive stretching Test : Severe pain on movement
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Early : Pain, paresthesia (reversible)
		- Late : Paralysis, Pulselessness (irreversible)
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical suspicion + intracompartmental pressure > 30 mm Hg (or within 30 mm Hg of diastolic BP)
	- ### Investigation
		- Compartment Pressure Monitoring (Gold Standard)
		- Imaging : X-ray (rule out fracture), MRI (chronic cases)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |DVT|Doppler US|
			  |Cellulitis|No fever, normal WBC|
			  |Nerve Injury| EMG/NCS|

	- ### Immediate Treatment #ortho-prof-card
		- Remove constrictive devices (casts, bandages)
		  *If Extrinsic Cause, then removal of cause*
		- Elevate for 30 mins to 1 hr
		  *but avoid excessive elevation → ↓ perfusion*
			- Check every 1 hr
		- If not improved, then fasciotomy
		  *Emergency fasciotomy if no improvement within 1-2 hours*
			- Forearm : Curvilinear incision (volar + dorsal release)
			- Leg : Anterolateral + Posteromedial incisions
				- liner incision in anterolateral and anteromedial leg
	- Post-Fasciotomy Care
		- Wound left open, delayed primary closure or skin grafting(split thickness)
			- dressing after closure
		- Monitor for rhabdomyolysis (CK levels, renal function)
