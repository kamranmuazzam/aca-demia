	- |Phenylketouria|Galactosemia|
	  |--|--|
	  |Deficient Phe hydrolxalase|Deficient G1p-uridyl-transferase. G1p accum to damage kidney, liver, brain |
	  |Sxs = MR, vomiting, athetosis, seizures, developmental delay over 1st few mos|Sxs = MR direct hyperbili & jaundice, ↓ glc, cataracts, seizures|
	  |Signs = fair hair, eyes, skin, musty smell|Predisposed to E. coli sepsis|

- A Yellow Baby
	- |fa|agqa|
	  |--|--|
	  |3 days old, bili @ 10, direct is 0.5. Eating & pooping well|Physiologic Jaundice. Gone by 5th DOL.[:br]Liver conjugation not yet mature|
	  |7 days old, bili @ 12, direct is 0.5. dry mucous memrbanes, not gaining weight|Breast feeding Jaundice. ↓ feeding = dehydration = retain meconium & reabsorb deconjugated bili|
	  |14 days old, bili @ 12, direct is 0.5. Baby regained birth weight, otehrwise heatlhy|Breast milk Jaundice. Breast milk has glucuronidase and do-conj bili|
	  |1 day old, bili @ 14, direct 0.5, Are you worried?[:br]- Next best test? Coombs[:br]- If positive? Measnt Rh or ABO incompatibility[:br]- If negative? Means twin/twin or mom/fetus transfusion, IDB, spherocytosis, G6p DH deficiency|Pathologic Jaundice = on 1st DOL, bili >12, d-bili >2, rate of rise > 5/day|

	  |Other causes of direct hyperbilirybinemia?|Always r/o sepsis! Galactosemia, hypothyroid, choledochal cyst, CF|
	  |Random inherited causes of indirect hyperbili? (2)|Gilbert : ↓ glucoronyl transferase level[:br]Crigler-Najjar. (type1) total deficiency|
	  |Random inherited causes of direct hyperbili (2)|Dublin Johnson. black liver[:br]Rotor. No black liver|
	  |Why do we care about hyperbilirubinemia?|Indirect bili can cross BBB, deposit in BG and brainstem nuclei and cause kernicterus (esp if bili is >20)|
	  |What is treatment?|Phototherapy -> ionizes the uncoj bili so it can be excrereted[:br]Double volume exchage transfusion if that doesn't work|
