	- ## Primary Prevention (Avoidance of risk factors)
		- ### Indentifying 'high-risk' female
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  collapsed:: true
			- Women with high-risk HPV infection
			- Early age of first pregnancy
			- High parity
			- Too many births/too frequent births
			- Long term use of combined oral contraceptives
			- Low socioeconomic status
			- Poor maintenance of local hygiene
		- ### Sexual behavior
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  collapsed:: true
			- Early sexual intercourse
			- Multiple sexual partners
			- Previous wife died of cervical carcinoma
		- ### Prophylactic HPV vaccine
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  collapsed:: true
			- Prophylactic HPV vaccine is approved to all school girls (12-18 years) and women (16-25 years). Two or three doses are usually to be given (Bivalent 0-2-6 month, Quadrivalent 0-1-6 month)
		- ### Use of condom
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ## Secondary Prevention
		- Early Diagnosis and Treatment
		- ### Screening
			- refer to [[ASCCP Management Guidelines]]
- ## Schedule for Mass Screening for Cervical Carcinoma
  ((67f8e818-0a55-479b-9a1f-8cefbc9cb307))
	- ### Principle
		- Cervical Carcinoma develops from premalignant lesions(CIN, SIL) over years
	- ### Screening Methods
		- Primary Test : Pap Smear (Cytology)
		- HPV Co-testing (High-risk HPV DNA/RNA testing)
		- Used adjunctively with Pap
	- ### Age & Frequency
		- Starts at 21 years
		- 21-29 years : Pap every 3 years
		- 30-65 years
			- Preferred : Pap + HPV co-testing every 5 years
				- If HPV positive but Pap smear negative then cervical cytology repeated every 6-12 months
			- Alternative : Pap alone every 3 years
		- Stop screening after 65 years if adequate prior screening and low risk
	- ### Follow up of Abnormal Results
		- ASC-US : Reflex HPV Testing
		- LSIL/HSIL : Colsposcopy + Biopsy
		- HPV 16/18+ : Immediate Colposcopy
	- ### Impact of Vaccination
		- Even if vaccine prevents 70-90% of cervical cancers, but is not replacement for screening
		- Screening must be carried out
	- Challanges in Mass Screening
		- False negatives (sampling errors)
		- Low coverage in resource limited settings (VIA as alternative)
