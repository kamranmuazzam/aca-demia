- Chronic and more common
- Characterized by
	- Slowly progressve raised [[IOP]]
	- Open normal appearing anterior chambers angle
	- Overproduction of fluid or too little drainage
	- Characteristic optic disc cupping and
	- Speicific visual field defects ((670679fd-0957-4e98-9774-c0ab0ad988ff))
	- Chronic Drug Therapy
- Associations
	- Age : 5th and 7th decades
	- Family history
		- 10% in siblings
		- 4% in the children
	- Race : African American
- Disc cupping
	- the cup to disk ratio increases
- Drugs
	- Parasympathomimetics
		- [[Pilocarpine]] , [[Carbachol]]
		- Muscarinic agonist
		- Contract ciliary muscle
		- Opens trabecular meshwork
		- More drainage
	- Alpha agonists
		- [[Brimonidine]] , [[Apraclonidine]]
		- Decrease aqueous production
		- Blocks ciliary epithelium
	- Beta-Blockers
		- [[Timolol]] , [[Betaxolol]], [[Carteolol]]
		- Decrease aqueous production
		- Blocks ciliary epithelium
	- Prostaglandin analogues
		- [[Latanoprost]], [[Travoprost]], [[Bimatoprost]], [[Tofluprost]]
		- Increase uveoscleral outflow of aquesous
	- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
		- Topical CA inhibitors
			- [[Dorzolamide]], [[Brinzolamide]]
			- ↓ production of [[Aqueous Humor]]
		- Oral CA inhibitors
			- [[Acetazolamide]] and [[Methazolamide]]
			- less commonly used due to their side effects, however given for short-term
	- Adrenergic drugs
		- Epinephrine
			- Early effect : ↑ [[Aqueous Humor]] (beta effect)
			  Later Effect : vasoconstrict ciliary body -> ↓ [[Aqueous Humor]] production
			- Never given in [[Closed Angle Glaucoma]]
				- Dilates pupil
				- Worsens angle closure
