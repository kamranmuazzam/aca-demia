- #definition A delusion is a fixed, false belief that is firmly held despite incontrovertible evidence to the contrary, not culturally sanctioned, and not attributable to another medical/psychiatric condition.
- # Presentation
	- ## Quality
		- **Fixed belief** : Resistant to rational argument or counterevidence
		- **Bizzare vs. Non-bizarre**
			- *Bizzare* : Impalusibel (e.g., *"Aliens control my thoughts"*)
			- **Non-bizarre** : Theoretically possible but false (e.g., *"My spouse is poisoning me"*)
		- **Themes** : Persecutory, grandiose, referential, somatic, nihilistic
	- ## Severity Scales
		- PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) : Rates delusions on a 1-7 scale
		- Delusion Assessment Scale : Evaluates conviction, disruption, and preoccupation
	- ## Timing
		- Acute onset : May suggest substance-induced [[psychosis]] or brief psychotic disorder.
		- Chronic : Seen in [[Schizophrenia]]/ [[Delusional Disorder]]
- # Epidemiology
	- Lifetime prevalence : ~0.2% (delusional disorder), higher in schizophrenia (~1%)
	- Higher in late adolescence/early adulthood (schizophrenia) or middle/older age (delusional disorder)
- # Associations
	- ## Associated Symptoms  
	  | **Symptom** | **Sensitivity (%)** | **Specificity (%)** | **PPV/NPV** | **Notes** |  
	  |[[Hallucination]]s|50-70%|60-80%|Moderate PPV|Common in schizophrenia|
	  | Disorganized speech | 30–50% | High | Variable | Suggests schizophrenia. |
	- ## Associated Conditions  
	  | **Condition** | **Pre-test Probability** | **Key Clues** | **Diagnostic Criteria** |  
	  | [[Schizophrenia]] | High | Hallucinations, disorganization | DSM-5/ICD-11 criteria (≥6 months) |
	  | [[Delusional Disorder]] | Low | Isolated delusions, no psychosis | Non-bizarre delusions, >1 month |
	  | Substance-induced | Variable | Temporal drug use | Urine toxicology, timeline |
- # Classification  
  | **Type** | **Criteria** | **Example Cause** |  
  | Persecutory | Belief of being harmed | Schizophrenia, dementia |
  | Grandiose | Inflated self-worth/power | Bipolar mania |
  | Somatic | False bodily beliefs | Delusional disorder |
- # Pathophysiology
	- **Dopamine dysregulation**: Mesolimbic hyperactivity (positive symptoms).
	- **Neuroanatomy**: Frontal/temporal lobe dysfunction, aberrant salience.
	- **Genetic**: Higher risk with family history (e.g., schizophrenia).
- # Red Flags
	- **Emergent**
		- Delusions + suicidal/homicidal ideation.
		- New-onset in elderly (possible stroke/tumor).
	- **Concerning**
		- Rapid functional decline.
		- Catatonia or aggression.
- # Management
	- ### Non-Pharmacologic
		- CBT for psychosis (challenge delusional beliefs).
		- Supportive therapy, family education.
	- ### Pharmacologic
		- Antipsychotics (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine).
		- Clozapine for treatment-resistant cases.
- # Complications
	- **Acute**: Self-harm, aggression, hospitalization.
	- **Chronic**: Social isolation, unemployment, anosognosia (lack of insight).
