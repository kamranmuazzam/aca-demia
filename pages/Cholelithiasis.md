- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- #### Metabolic Theory
			- normal composition of bile, cholesterol:bile salt is 1:20
			- This composition is altered, i-e Cholesterol and bile salt becomes 20:1
			- This extra cholesterol(Lithogenic bile, Supersaturated bile) gets deposited in gallbladder and leads to cholesterol stone formation
			- *This occurs more in Gallstone ileus*
			- Risk Factors (6F)
				- Female
				- Forty
				- Fair
				- Fertile
				- Flatulence
				- Fatty
		- #### Infective Theory
			- Salmonella typhii
			- Salmonella paratyphi
			- Clonorchis sinensis
			- E. coli
		- #### Stasis
			- During Fasting
			- Decreased contraction of gall bladder as no release of cholecystokinin
			- Deposition of solid particles of bile
			- This causes Gallstone formation

	- `In obstruction of the common bile duct due to a stone, distension of the gall bladder seldom occurs; the organ usually is already shrivelled.`
