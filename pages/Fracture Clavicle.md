alias:: Clavicular Fracture
ICD-11_Code:: FB32.0 (Fracture of Clavicle)
tags:: disease, orthopedics, trauma, pediatrics, fracture

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Direct trauma (e.g., fall onto shoulder, MVCs, sports injuries)
		- Indirect trauma (e.g., fall on outstretched hand)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Age (peak incidence in young males <25 years and elderly)
		- Osteoporosis (pathological fractures in elderly)
		- Contact sports (e.g., rugby, football)
		- for Neonatal
			- Macrosomia
			- Shoulder dystocia
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- 10-15% of pediatric fractures
		- ~5% of all adult
	- ### Prevalence
		- ### Demographics
			- Bimodal
				- Young males (high energy trauma)
				- elderly (low energy falls)
			- Most common fracture in neonates (birth trauma)
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease #ortho-prof-written
		- Fall on outstretched hand
		- Fall on shoulder
		- |Part|Mechanism|
		  |--|--|
		  |Lateral 1/3|Fall onto acromion(coracoclavicular ligament disruption)|
		  |Middle 1/3 <br />80% of cases|Direct blow or fall on shoulder|
		  |Medial 1/3 fracture <br />(rare)|High energy trauma <br />(rule out mediastinal injury)|
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Brachial plexus/subclavian vessel injury (rare but critical)
		- Mediastinum
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Pain
			- Swelling
			- Drooping of shoulder supported by contralateral hand
			- Crepitus/deformity (e.g., "bump" over clavicle)
		- #### Signs
	- ### Stages or Classification
	  *[[Allman]] System*
		- |Type|Location|Key Features|
		  |I|Middle 1/3 (most common)| Non-displaced: Sling <br />Displaced: ORIF if >2|
		  |II|Lateral 1/3|Coracoclavicular ligament involvement -> higher nonunion risk|
		  |III| Medial 1/3rd | Rare; assess for mediastinal injury (CT iff displaced)|
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical + Imaging(X-ray)
	- ### Imaging Studies
		- X-Ray
			- AP view (+/- 45ยบ cephalic tilt for medial fractures)
			- Swimmers view
		- CT-scanning with 3d reconstruction
		  *For medial fractures or suspected mediastinal involvement*
	- ### Differential Diagnosis
		- AC joint separation, sternoclavicular dislocation
- ## Management and Treatment #ortho-prof-written
  background-color:: blue
	- 10 years old boy #ortho-prof-written
	- type I : simple sling with elbow bag for 1-3 weeks
		- displaced : retention by plate and screw
		  *special contour locking plates are available for that*
	- type II : Sling for 2-3 weeks followed by mobilization within the limit of pain
		- displaced : coracoclavicular scew and plate/ hook plate fixation
	- type III : Mainly managed non-surgically
		- displaced : surgical management, suture and graft technique, plate
		  *mediastinal injuries is possible*
	- ### Non-Surgical
		- Indication: Non-displaced or minimally displaced fractures
			- Treatment
				- Sling for 2-4 weeks (early pendulum exercises to prevent stiffness)
				- Pediatric fractures : Heal rapidly (3-6 weeks)
	- ### Surgical (ORIF)
		- Indications
			- Dispalcement > 2cm, open fracture, neurovascular compromise
			- Type II lateral fractures (high nonunion risk)
		- Option
			- Plate fixation (pre-contoured locking plates)
			- Intramedullary screws (cosmetically preferred)
	- ### Additional
		- Check for Mediastinal Injuries if type III clavicular fracture
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
	- ### Follow-up
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- Nonunion(5-10%): Higher in Type II fractures
	- Malunion: "Bump" deformity (usually cosmetic only)
	- Rare: Brachial plexus injury, pneumothorax(medial fractures)
