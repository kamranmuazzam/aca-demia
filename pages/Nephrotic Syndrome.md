  - ### Affected Systems/Organs
    - Damage to the podocytes (effacement of foot process)
    - Increase permeability of GFB
    - ↑↑passage of albumin across GFB into the urinary space
    - This massive albumin loss in urine(Albuminuria) gives rise to hypoalbuminemia with fall of plasma Colloidal osmotic pressure. As a result, fluid shifts from plasma to interstitial space, resulting in
      - [[Generalized Edema]]
      - [[Haemoconcentration]] as reduced blood colloidal osmotic pressure
    - Further retaining of fluid leading to Edema
      - The Haemoconcentration in turn activates the renin angiotensin aldosterone system and promotes release of ADH
      - This causes the body to retain more fluid, reduced GFR and oligouria
    - Raised Cholesterol and Triglycerides
      - Hypoalbuminaemia induces lipoprotein synthesis in liver which causes elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides in blood
- # Essential Characteristics of MCNS
  - No appreciable glomerular pathology, noted in light microscopy but effacement of foot processes of podocytes in GBM seen under electron microscope
  - Prompt respose to steroid but high tendency to relapse
  - Not associated with hypertension, hematuria and azoteaemia
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
  - ### Clinical Presentation
    - The affected children may present as initial case or may present with History of recurrent attacks(replapse) with
    - #### Symptoms
      - Anorexia
      - Irritability
      - Abdominal pain
      - Diarrhoea
      - Scanty urination (color usually normal)
    - #### Signs
      - Facial puffiness, massive peri-orbital swelling
      - Generalized oedema
  - ### Stages or Classification
  - ### Diagnostic Criteria
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
  - ### Clinical Diagnosis
    - #### Classical Presentation
      - Following minor infections and uncommonly reactions to insect bites, bee stings, or poison ivy
      - Mild edema, initially periorbital which decreases throughout the day and the edema becomes generalized
        possibly misdiagnosed as allergic disorder
      - Anorexia, irritability, abdominal pain, diarrhoea
    - #### Probable Diagnosis
    - Diagnosis other than [[MCNS]] should be considered in children <1 year of age, with a positive family history of nephrotic syndrome, and/or presence of extrarenal findings (e.g., arthritis, rash, anemia), hypertension or pulmonary edema, acute or chronic renal insufficiency, and gross hematuria
  - ### Laboratory Tests
    - Urine RME with the first morning urine : 3+ or 4+ (20% sensitive)
    - 24 hour timed collection of urine for protein quantification
    - spot Urine Protein : Creatinine ratio >2.0
    - Creatinine : normal
      may be abnormally elevated if there is diminished renal perfusion from contractiion of teh intravascular volume
    - Serum Albumin : < 2/5 g/dL
    - Serum Cholesterol and Triglycerides : elevated
    - complement C3 and C4 levels : normal
      (decreased C3 in glomerulonephritis)
    - CBC
    - Serum electrolytes
    - BUN
    - Glomerular filtration rate
    - Antinuclear and anti-streptococcal antibodies
    - Antineutrophilic cytoplastic antibodies
  - ### Imaging Studies
    - Kidney ultrasound may be considered to exclude renal maformations and venous thrombosis but is not mandatory
  - ### Renal Biopsy
    - Renal biopsy is not routinely performed if the patient fits the standard clinical picture of MCNS
    - should be considered for renal biopsy if
      - Age <1 year or >12 years
      - Persistent or sustained elevation in creatinine
      - Significant hematuria or gross hematuria
      - sustained hypertension
      - Hypocomplementemia
      - Findings indicative of another autoimmune disease
      - Infection with Hepatitis B or C, HIV, or tuberculosis
      - Glucocorticoid resistance
      - [[AKI]]
      - Arthritis
      - Rash
  - ### Differential Diagnosis
    - #### Differential Diagnosis
      _child with marked edema_
      - Protein losing enteropathy
      - Hepatic Failure
      - Heart Failure
      - Acute or chronic glomerulonephritis
      - Protein malnutrition
  - ### Confirmation of Diagnosis
    - labs, imaging and biopsy not necessary
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
  - First episode of nephrotic syndrome and mild to moderate edema may be managed as outpatients.
  - But, not practiced as outpatient, as educating parents regarding all aspects of the condition can require a short period of hospitalization
  - The child's parents must be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of the complications of the disease and may be taught how to use a dipstick and interpret the results to monitor for the degree of proteinuria
  - ### Medical Treatment
    - More than 95% of children with minimal change disease respond to corticosteroid therapy
      - Prednisone : {{c1 60}} mg/m2/day (max {{c1 60}} mg) for 4-6 weeks followed by alternate day prednisone {{c1 40}} mg/m2 every other day for 4-6 weeks #pedi-prof-written #card #dose

        id:: 67594233-18a5-4605-bb2c-b8afc0f1cf75
    - Tuberculosis must be ruled out before starting immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteoids by placing a purified protein derivative skin test or obtaining an interferon-gamma release assay and confirming a negative result

  - ### Expected Course
    - #### With Treatment
    - #### Without Treatment
      - Cough & respiratory distress (pneumonia, pleural effusion, huge ascites)
      - Abdominal pain(gut ischemia, peritonitis, renal vein thrombosis)
      - Pain, redness & tendreness of skin(cellulitis)
      - Fever & dysuria (UTI)
      - Diarrhoea(impaired absorption of foods due to oedema of the bowel wall)
      - Neurodeficit like hemiplegia (stroke from thrombo-embolism due to haemoconcentration)
  - ### Survival Rates
    - #### With Treatment
      - Remission achieved after 8 week of oral corticosteroid therapy : 90%
