	- Oropharyngeal Causes
	- Esophageal Causes
- alias:: Difficulty swallowing
  ICD-11_Code:: MD42.0
  tags:: symptom
- #definition
  Difficulty or inability to initiate swallowing or the sensation that food/liquid is hindered in its passage from mouth to stomach.
- # Clinical Approach
- ### History
	- Determine if the patient has true dysphagia vs. odynophagia vs. both
	- Duration and pattern of dysphagia
		- abrupt vs. gradual onset
		- consistent vs. intermittent
		- solids only vs. solids & liquid both
	- Associated symptoms
		- heartburn
		- weight loss
		- vomiting
		- vertigo
		- coughing
		- changes in speech
		- halitosis
		- dry eyes
	- Past Medical Health
		- Neurological Disease
		- History of Recurrent Pneumonia
		- Aspiration
		- Radiation Therapy
		- Caustic Ingestion
	- Examination
		- Vitals
		- Inspection of the oral cavity
		- Lymph node and neck exam
		- Abdominal exam
		  *e.g., palpation of epigastric region*
		- Cardiac ausculation
		- Thorough neuro exam
	- Tests
		- Videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow (a.k.a. "videofluoroscopic swallow study")
		- Nasopharyngoscopy / FEES
		- Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
		- Barium swallow study
		- Esophageal manometry
		- CT chest
	- **Key questions**:
		- "Do you have trouble starting to swallow, or does food get stuck after swallowing?"
		- "Is it worse for solids, liquids, or both?"
		- "Any associated weight loss, pain, or regurgitation?"
	- **Temporal pattern**: Acute vs. chronic, progressive vs. intermittent
	- **Red flags**: Weight loss, odynophagia, hematemesis
	- **Differentiate from**: [[Odynophagia]], [[Globus pharyngeus]]
- Investigations/Approach
  #ent-prof-written
	- *Use History to distinguish between Oropharyngeal Dysphagia or Esophageal Dysphagia*
		- Probable oropharyngeal dysphagia
			- Conditions to suggest Oropharyngeal Dysphagia
				- Difficulty initiating swallow (i.e. dysphagia is immediate)
				- Drooling, food spillage
				- Coughing, "choking" sensation
				- Repeated swallows needed to clear the pharynx
				- History of preexisting neurologic or myopathic pathology
			- For Suspected Oropharyngeal Dysphagia
			  *Specific diagnosis strongly suggested -> Focused workup as appropriate*
				- Structural etiology felt most likely -> Nasopharyngeoscopy/ FEES
					- For visible abnormality(structural) -> Biopsy
				- Neurologic or myopathic etiology felt most likely -> Videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow
					- Suggestion of UES pathology -> UES manometry
				- If anyone of the test is done and is normal or nondiagnostic, then the other test is also done
		- Probable Esophageal Dysphagia
			- Conditions to suggest Esophageal Dysphagia
				- Delayed of several seconds between inititiation of swallow and dysphagia symptom
				- Odynophagia
				- Sensation of food "getting stuck" in the chest
				- History of preexisting esophageal pathology
			- For Suspected Esophageal Dysphagia
				- EGD is the next step, but some alternatives considered
					- if <50 years of age, and no red flags->4 week trial of PPI
					- If known upper esophageal pathology (e.g., stricture) -> Barium swallow
				- if EGD is Normal, dysphagia just to solids -> Barium swallow
				- If EGD/Barium swallow shows intrinsic abnormality -> Biopsy
				- if EGD/Barium swallow suggests Extrinsic abnormality -> CT chest
				- if EGD is Normal, dysphagia to both solid and liquids or Barium swallow and CT are normal -> Esophageal manometry
				- if all normal -> Consider functional dysphagia (Chest CT if not done yet)
		- if, one pathway is all negative, switch pathway
		  like, from oropharyngeal dysphagia to esophageal dysphagia and vice versa because the history is not perfect
- ### Physical Exam
	- **General**: Nutritional status, neck masses
	- **Neurologic**: Cranial nerves (IX, X, XII), gag reflex
	- **ENT**: Oral cavity inspection, laryngeal elevation
- # Investigations
- ### First-line
  | **Test** | **When to Use** | **Findings** |
  |---|---|---|
  | Barium swallow | Oropharyngeal dysphagia | Aspiration, cricopharyngeal bar |
  | Upper endoscopy | Suspected esophageal pathology | Strictures, tumors, esophagitis |
  | Bedside swallow eval | All patients | Risk of aspiration |
- ### Advanced
  | **Test** | **Indication** | **Diagnostic Yield** |
  |---|---|---|
  | Esophageal manometry | Motility disorders | 90% for achalasia |
  | CT/MRI | Suspected malignancy or stroke | Structural lesions |
  | pH monitoring | Refractory GERD | Acid exposure time |
- # Presentation
	- ## Quality
		- Oropharyngeal: Coughing/choking immediately after swallow
		- Esophageal: Retrosternal food sticking
		- Globus: Sensation of throat lump without dysphagia
	- ## Severity Scales
		- **FOIS**: 1 (NPO) to 7 (total oral diet)
		- **DOSS**: Level 1 (severe) to 7 (normal)
	- ## Timing
		- Acute: Stroke, foreign body
		- Chronic progressive: Esophageal CA
		- Intermittent: Eosinophilic esophagitis
- # Epidemiology
	- Post-stroke: 30-50% incidence
	- Elderly: 15-22% community prevalence
- # Classification  
  | **Type** | **Localization** | **Hallmark** |
  |---|---|---|
  | Oropharyngeal | Mouth to UES | Difficulty initiating |
  | Esophageal | UES to stomach | Food "sticking" |

- # Pathophysiology
	- **Neurologic**: Brainstem strokes (nucleus ambiguus)
	- **Mechanical**: Luminal obstruction (tumors)
	- **Motility**: Achalasia (LES failure to relax)
- # Red Flags
	- **Emergent**:
		- Complete obstruction (drooling)
		- Febrile + dysphagia (retropharyngeal abscess)
	- **Concerning**:
		- Age >50 + progressive symptoms
		- Iron deficiency anemia
	- Weight Loss
	- Immunocompromised
	- Lymphadenopathy
	- Palpable epigastric mass
- # Management
- ### Stepwise Approach
  1. **Stabilize**: NPO if high aspiration risk
  2. **Diagnose**: Endoscopy vs. barium study
  3. **Treat**:
	- Mechanical: Dilation/stenting
	- Neurologic: SLP referral
- ### Specific Therapies
  | **Condition** | **Treatment** |
  |---|---|
  | Achalasia | Pneumatic dilation |
  | EoE | Swallowed fluticasone |
- # Complications
	- **Acute**: Aspiration pneumonia
	- **Chronic**: Esophageal perforation
