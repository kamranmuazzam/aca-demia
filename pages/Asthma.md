alias:: Bronchial Asthma
ICD-11_Code::
tags:: disease, medicine, pulmunology, paediatrics
high-yeild:: true

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Allergens (dust mites, pollen, animal dander)
		- Respiratory infections (viral-RSV, rhinovirus)
		- Air pollutants (smoke, chemical fumes)
		- Drugs (NSAIDs, beta-blockers)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Atopy (eczema, allergic rhinitis)
		- Family history of asthma/atopy
		- Prematurity & low brith weight
		- Smoking (active/passive)
		- Obesity
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- Common in childhood (peaks at 3-5 years)
	- ### Prevalence
		- ~300 million globally
		- Higher in developed countries
		- ### Demographics
			- More common in boys(childhood), equalizes in adults
			- Higher in urban vs. rural areas
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Higher in Western countries ([[Hygiene Hypothesis]])
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Chronic airway inflammation (TH2 mediated, eosinophils, mast cells)
		- Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness -> reversible airflow obstruction
		- Mucus hypersecretion -> plugging
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Lungs (bronchoconstriction, inflammation)
		- Cardiovascular (pulsus paradoxus in severe attacks)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
	  #im-prof-written
		- Acute Bronchial Asthma
		  #im-prof-written
		- #### Symptoms
			- Wheezing (expiratory > inspiratory)
			- Dyspnea, chest tightness
			- Nocturnal cough (classic in children)
		- #### Signs
			- Tachypnea, tachycardia
			- Prolonged expiratory phase
			- Use of accessory muscles
			- Silent chest (ominous sign in severe asthma)
	- ### Stages or Classification
	  #im-prof-written
		- Intermittent (symptoms <2x/week)
		- Mild Persistent (symptoms >2x/week but <daily)
		- Moderate Persistent (daily symptoms, nighttime > 1x/week)
		- Severe Persistent (continuous symptoms, frequent nighttime)
		- |Classification|Symptoms|Night Cough|FEV1|Recommended Treatment|
		  |--|--|--|--|--|
		  |Intermittent|2x a week|-|normal|Albuterol only|
		  |Mild Persistent|4x a week|2x a month|normal|Albuterol + ICS|
		  |Moderate Persistent|daily|2x a week|60%-80%|Albuterol + ICS + Salmeterol|
		  |Severe Persistent|daily|4x a week|<60%|Albuterol+ICS+salmeterol+montelukast and oral steroids|
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- History (recurrent wheeze, cough, diurnal variation)
		- Spirometry : FEV1/FVC < 0.7, improvement post-bronchodilator (>12%)
		- Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) variability (>20%)
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Spirometry (gold standard)
			- PEF monitoring (home monitoring)
			- FeNO (fractional exhaled nitric oxide, marker of eosinophilic inflammation)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- | **Differential Diagnosis** | **Shared Features** | **Clinical Exclusion** | **Baseline Workup** | **Direct Testing** |
			  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
			  | **[[Hysterical Hyper Ventilation]]** | Dyspnea, anxiety | No wheezing, normal PEF | ABG (respiratory alkalosis) | Psychiatric evaluation |
			  | **[[COPD]]** | Chronic dyspnea, wheeze | Smoking history, irreversible obstruction | Spiro (post-BD FEV1/FVC <0.7, no reversibility) | CT chest (emphysema) |
			  | **Heart Failure (CCF)** | Dyspnea, nocturnal cough, wheeze (cardiac asthma) | Bilateral crackles, elevated JVP, BNP/NT-proBNP ↑ | CXR (pulmonary edema), ECG, BNP | Echocardiogram (LV dysfunction) |
			  | **Upper Airway Obstruction** (tumor, foreign body, tracheal stenosis) | Stridor, wheeze (monophonic) | Fixed inspiratory stridor, no response to bronchodilators | Flow-volume loop (variable obstruction) | CT neck/chest, bronchoscopy |
			  | **Bronchiectasis** | Chronic cough, wheeze, recurrent infections | Purulent sputum, clubbing, coarse crackles | CXR (tram-track/tubular shadows) | HRCT chest (dilated bronchi) |
			  | **Pulmonary Embolism (PE)** | Acute dyspnea, hypoxia | Pleuritic chest pain, DVT signs, normal PEF | D-dimer, Wells score | CTPA/V/Q scan |
			  | **GERD** | Chronic cough, wheeze (microaspiration) | Heartburn, postprandial symptoms | Trial of PPIs | pH/impedance study |
			  | **Eosinophilic Lung Disease** (e.g., ABPA, EGPA) | Wheeze, eosinophilia | History of atopy, asthma refractory to treatment | Serum IgE, eosinophil count | CT chest (central bronchiectasis in ABPA), ANCA (EGPA) |
			  | **Vocal Cord Dysfunction (VCD)** | Intermittent dyspnea, stridor | Sudden onset/cessation, normal PEF between attacks | Flow-volume loop (inspiratory flattening) | Laryngoscopy |
		- ### General Assessment
			- CXR (exclude pneumothorax, infection)
			- ABG (hypoxia, low PCO2 early; rising PCO2 = respiratory failure)
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Severe Acute Bronchial Asthma
		  #im-prof-written
			- High-flow O2 (target SpO2 ≥ 92%)
			- Nebulized SABA (salbutamol) + ipratropium
			- Systemic steroids (oral/IV prednisolone)
			- IV magnesium sulfate (if severe)
			- Intubation if fatigue, rising PCO2, silent chest
	- Preventive Drugs with Potential Side Effects in Long Term Management
	  #im-prof-written
		- Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) -> oral thrush, dysphonia
		- Long acting Beta Agonists -> tachycardia, tolerance
		- Leukotriene antagonists (monteleukast) -> mood changes
		- Theophylline -> narrow therapeutic window (toxicity; arrhythmias, seizures)
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Bronchial thermoplasty (severe refractory asthma)
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Avoid Triggers (allergens, smoking)
		- Weight loss (if. obese)
		- Vaccinations (influenza, pneumococcal)
	- ### Follow-up
		- PEF monitoring
		- Step-up/step-down therapy based on control
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Good control in most patients
			- Reduced exacerbations
				- in acute exacerbation, if exacerbation not reduced and pCO2 rising towards normal -> intubate
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Status asthmaticus, respiratory failure
				- Pneumothorax (rare)
				- Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA)
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Airway remodelling -> irreversible obstruction
	- ### Survival Rates
		- #### With Treatment
			- Excellent with adherent
		- #### Without Treatment
			- Fatal if untreated severe attacks
	- ### Quality of Life Considerations
- ## Prevention

	- Smoking Cessation
	- Allergen Avoidance
	- Early ICS use (prevents remodeling)

- ## Guidelines and Protocols
  background-color:: blue
	- If pt has sxs twice a week and PFTs are normal? Albuterol only
	- If pt has sxs 4x a week, night cough 2x a month and PFTs are normal? Albuterol + inhaled CS
	- If pt has sxs daily, night cough 2x a week and FEV1 is 60-80% Albuterol + inhaled CS + long acting beta ag (salmeterol)
	- If pt has sxs daily, night cough 4x a week and FEV1 is <60? Albuterol + ihaled CS + salmeterol + montelukast and oral steroids
	- Exacerbation -> tx w/ inhaled albuterol and PO/IV steriods. Watch peak flow rates and blood gas. PCO2 should be low. Normalizing PCO2 means impending respiratory failure -> INTUBATE
	- Complications -> Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillus
