  tags:: disease, mental health, psychiatry  

- ## Etiology  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Causative Agents  
		- **Biological factors**: Neurotransmitter imbalances (e.g., serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), genetic predisposition.  
		- **Psychological factors**: Chronic stress, trauma, maladaptive thought patterns.  
		- **Environmental factors**: Loss, abuse, socioeconomic hardship.  
	- ### Risk Factors  
		- Family history of depression.  
		- Chronic medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease).  
		- Substance abuse.  
		- Social isolation.  

- ## Epidemiology  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Incidence  
		- ~3-5% of adults annually.  
	- ### Prevalence  
		- Lifetime prevalence: ~15-20%.  
		- ### Demographics  
			- Higher in women (2:1 ratio compared to men).  
			- Peak onset in early adulthood.  
	- ### Geographic Distribution  
		- Global, with higher rates in urbanized regions.  

- ## Pathophysiology  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Mechanism of Disease  
		- Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.  
		- Reduced neuroplasticity (e.g., hippocampal atrophy).  
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs  
		- **Central Nervous System**: Prefrontal cortex, amygdala.  
		- **Endocrine System**: Cortisol dysregulation.  

- ## Clinical Features  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Clinical Presentation  
		- #### Symptoms  
			- Persistent sadness, anhedonia, fatigue, guilt, suicidal ideation.  
		- #### Signs  
			- Psychomotor retardation/agitation, poor hygiene, weight changes.  
	- ### Stages or Classification  
		- Mild, moderate, severe (with/without psychotic features).  

- ## Diagnosis  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria  
		- **DSM-5**: ≥5 symptoms for ≥2 weeks, including depressed mood or anhedonia.  
	- ### Investigation  
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis  
			- Clinical interviews (e.g., PHQ-9, Beck Depression Inventory).  
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis  
			-  
			  | DD                | Ruling Out                          |  
			  |-------------------|-------------------------------------|  
			  | Bipolar Disorder  | No history of mania/hypomania.      |  
			  | Hypothyroidism   | Check TSH levels.                   |  
		- ### General Assessment  
			- Rule out medical causes (e.g., vitamin deficiencies).  

- ## Management and Treatment  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Medical Treatment  
		- **Antidepressants**: SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine), SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine).  
		- **Psychotherapy**: CBT, interpersonal therapy.  
	- ### Surgical Options  
		- **Last-resort**: Deep brain stimulation (experimental).  
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations  
		- Regular exercise, balanced diet (omega-3s, vitamin D).  
	- ### Follow-up  
		- Monitor for suicidal ideation, treatment adherence.  

- ## Prognosis  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Expected Course  
		- #### With Treatment  
			- 60-70% respond to first-line therapy.  
		- #### Without Treatment  
			- Chronicity, increased suicide risk.  
			- ##### Possible Complications  
				- Substance abuse, self-harm.  
			- ##### Long-Term Effects  
				- Cognitive decline, social dysfunction.  
	- ### Survival Rates  
		- Suicide mortality: ~2% in severe cases.  
	- ### Quality of Life Considerations  
		- Functional impairment in work/relationships.  

- ## Prevention  
  background-color:: blue  
	- ### Health Education  
		- Mental health awareness campaigns.  
	- ### Community Approach
