- #definition A body temperature of 38 ºC (100.4 ºF) or higher is considered a fever
- Approach
	- Duration
	- Onset : Morning, Evening, Night
	- Persistence : Few Hours or Throughout Day or Night
	- Highest Recorded Temperature
	- Association with Chills and Rigor
	- Subsiding after sweating
	- Spontaneous subsiding or subsiding with antipyretic
		- if spontaneous remission, period of intervening afebrile period
		- if no spontaneous remission, does it fluctuate more than 2ºC or not more than 1ºC
		- This is to classify fever into continuous, remittent or intermittent
	- If fever is punctuated by apyrexial period : Undulant or Pel-Ebstein
	- Association with rash or purpura
	- Any other associated symptom : urinary complain, cough, chest pain, pain abdomen, headache, impaired or loss of consciousness, weight loss, polyarthritis
	- History of sexual exposure : Homosexuality, travel abroad
	- Drug History : To exclude any drug fever
- Etiology
	- most-likely : viral fever which is self limiting, spontaneous resolution in 7 days
	- Low grade fever with evening rise - tuberculosis
	- Fever with chill and rigor
		- acute pyelonephritis
		- acute cholangitis
		- subacute bacterial endocarditis
		- subphrenic abscess
		- pyogenic lung abscess
		- septicemia
		- lobar pneumonia
		- pyrogenic reaction after infusion or transfusion
		- Fever with chill and rigor that subsides with sweating - malaria
		- Fever with unconsciousness
			- cerebral malaria
			- meningitis
			- encephalitis
			- pontine hemorrhage
		- Fever with neck rigidity
			- meningitis
			- encephalitis
		- Fever with drenching night sweat
			- lymphoma

- ## Classification
	- | Type of Fever   | Temperature                         |
	  | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
	  | Low-grade Fever | 100.4 ºF - 102.2 ºF (38 ºC - 39 ºC) |
	  | Moderate Fever  | 102.2 ºF - 104 ºF (39 ºC - 40 ºC)   |
	  | High Fever      | >104 ºF (>40 ºC)                    |
	- | Type of Fever  | Duration  |
	  | -------------- | --------- |
	  | Acute Fever    | <7 days   |
	  | Subacute Fever | 7-14 days |
	  | Chronic Fever  | >14 days  |
	- | Type of Fever      | Pattern                                                                                             |
	  | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
	  | Intermittent Fever | Fever episodes alternate with periods of normal temperature (e.g., [[Malaria]]).                    |
	  | Remittent Fever    | Fever fluctuates but does not return to normal (e.g., [[Typhoid]] )                                 |
	  | Continuous Fever   | Fever remains consistently elevated (e.g., [[Pneumonia]] )                                          |
	  | Relapsing Fever    | Episodes of fever occur intermittently with periods of normal temperature (e.g., [[Lyme Disease]] ) |

- ## Pathophysiology
	- ![2-Figure1-1.png](../assets/2-Figure1-1_1728441460583_0.png){:height 591, :width 301}
- ## Symptomatic Management
	- Pharmacolgical
		- Antipyretics
			- [[Paracetamol]]
			- [[NSAIDS]]
		- [[Corticosteroids]]
		- [[Antibiotics]]
	- Non Pharmacological
		- Hydration
		- Physical Cooling Methods
			- Luke-warm sponge baths
				- avoid cold baths, as it can cause shivering and rise in temperature (do not submerge in ice bath even if sever rise of temperature, this is not a move, and it can be counterintuitive)
				- avoid alcohol application all over the body, this can lead to alcohol poisoning
				- monitor for shivering
			- Cooling baths, sponge (forehead, neck, armpits, groin)
		- Comfort Measures
			- Rest
			- Light Clothing
		- Ventilation
		- Diet : easily digestible food, focus on nutrition & hydration
- ## Complications
	- Dehydration
	- Febrile seizures in young children
	- Organ Dysfucntion
	- Rhabdomyolysis
	- Hyperthermia
