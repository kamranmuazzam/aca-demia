- The fluorescein test is a diagnostic proceudure used in opthalmology to assess corneal integrity, detect foreign bodies, and evaluate tear film dynamics
- # Procedure
	- A sterile fluorescein-impregnated strip is moistened with saline
	- The strip is lightly applied to the conjunctival sac, staining the tear film
	- The patient is asked to blink repeatedly to spread the dye.
	- A cobalt blue light is used to examine the eye, causing fluorescein to emit a green glow
- # Uses
	- Corneal Abrasions/ Ulcers : Defects in the epithelium retain dye, appearing green
	- Dry Eye (Tear Break-Up Time TBUT) : Measures how quickly tears evaporate
	- Seidel Test : Detects aqueous humor leakage in penetrating injuries (diluted fluorescein streams indicate leakage)
	- Contact Lens Fit Assessment : Evaluates lens alignment
- # Advantage
	- Non-invasive, quick, and in expensive
	- Highly sensitive for epithelial defects
- # Limitations
	- Cannot detect deeper stromal injuries (may require rose bengal or lissamine green)
	- Temporary discoloration of tears
- *This test is essential in emergency and routine ophthalmic practice for diagnosing surface disorders*
