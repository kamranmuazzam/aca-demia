- #definition It is the  process by which formation and maturation of erythrocytes in the Red bone marrow from pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell under normal physiological condition
- # Site of development
	- Intrauterine life
		- mesoblastic
			- 1st trimester
			- mesoderm in yolk sac
			- primitive nucleated RBC
		- hepatic
			- 2nd trimester
			- liver, spleen
		- myeloid
			- 3rd trimester
			- bone marrow
	- after birth : all bone marrow
	- after 20 years
		- vertebra
		- sternum
		- ribs, and other flat bone
- # Stages of Differentiation of RBC
	- proerythroblast
	- basophil erythroblast
	- polychromatic erythroblast
	- orthochromatic erythroblast
	- reticulocyte
	- erythrocytes
- changes occurring
	- reduction of size and changes in shape
	- disappearance of nucleus
	- appearance of hemoglobin
	- a change in staining of cytoplasm from basophilic to eosinophilic
- site of erythropoiesis
	- 1st trimester(1-3 months)
		- Mesoderm of yolk sac (mesoblastic erythropoiesis)
	- 2nd trimester(4-6 months)
		- Liver (Hepatic erythropoiesis)
		- Spleen
		- Lymph nodes
	- 3rd trimester(7-9 months)
		- Red bone marrow of all bones (Myeloid erythropoiesis)
	- After birth
		- upto 5 years
			- Red bone marrow of all bones
		- After the age of 20
			- In the marrow of membranous bone or flat bone such as ribs, sternum, vertebrae and pelvis (hip bone)
- important landmarks
	- Hb appearance begins at basophil erythroblast stage and complete at polychromatophilic erythroblast
		- production of hemoglobin(Hb) continues from the [proerythroblast](https://www.remnote.com/doc/pkhtnXhSGYsKkg8WN?isPin=false) to [reticulocyte](https://www.remnote.com/doc/eDCYcJjiAdrYiyebB?isPin=false) in the bone marrow
	- Nucleus dissapearance
		- beings at basophil erythroblast stage
		- completes at orthochromatic erythroblast
- Regulation
	- Stimulating factors
		- erythropoietin
			- synthesis
				- site
					- kidney ({{6076984020602674::90}}% of total)
						- cortex : fibroblast like interstitial cells in the  peritubular capillary bed
					- liver ({{23573351424565447::10}}% of total)
						- absence of kidney causes anemia
							- because: liver is not capable of compensating for lack of erythropoietin and only is sufficient for 1/3â€”1/2 RBC formation needed by the body
				- mechanism of stimulation
					- hypoxia-inducible factor-1
					- transcription factor for a large number of hypoxia inducible genes
						- erythropoietin gene
							- hypoxia response element
								- [HIF-1](https://www.remnote.com/doc/aKypuYXXbuXMMKG9R?aliasId=fuuJfK6EmE8YjabgG?isPin=false)  binds here
								- transcription of mRNA
								- increased erythropoietin synthesis
				- paraneoplastic syndrome
					- abnormal production of erythropoietin
					- in
						- renal cell carcinoma
						- hepatocellular carcinoma
			- mechanism of action
				- production of proerythroblast from hematopoietic stem cell
				- increase the speed of hematopoiesis
			- regulation within narrow limits, because
				- lower RBC count cannot fulfill transport of adequate oxygen
				- more RBC count impedes blood flow
			- Stimulus
				- Physiological/Pathological Hypoxia
				- Androgen
				- Estrogen
				- Alkalosis
				- Adenosine
			- Epoetin
				- artificial erythropoietin
		- hypoxia
			- increases the release of erythropoietin
			- renal tissue hypoxia
			- hypoxia in other tissues
				- signaling to kidney by release of
					- norepinephrine and epinephrine
					- prostaglandins
				- directly produced by liver - 10%
		- other hormones
			- growth hormone
			- ACTH
			- testosterone
				- it is the reason males have more RBC count
	- maturation factors
		- they are
			- vitamin B12
			- folic acid
			- intrinsic factor of castle
		- deficiency will cause megaloblastic anaemia
	- general factors
		- food - 1st class protein
		- growth inducers - interleukin - 3
		- differentiation inducers - IL-1, IL-3, IL-6
		- vitamin : vitamin B12, folic acid, vitamin C
		- metal : Iron, Cu, Ca++, Co
		- Intrinsic factor of castle
