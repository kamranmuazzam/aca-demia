tags:: disease

- #definition Tortuosity, dilatation and elongation of anorectal venous plexus
- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Chronic increased intra-abdominal pressure
		- Weakening of supportive connective tissue
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Chronic constipation straining during defacation
		- Prolonged sitting (e.g., sedentary lifestyle, toilet habits)
		- Obesity
		- Pregnancy (due to increased pelvic pressure)
		- Low-fiber diet
		- Heavy lifting
		- Portal hypertension (e.g., liver cirrhosis)
		- Family history
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- Common, affecting ~5% of the general population
	- ### Prevalence
		- ~50% of adults by age 50
		- ### Demographics
			- More common in males
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Higher in Western countries due to low-fiber diets
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Increased venous pressure -> engorgement of hemorrhoidal plexus -> prolapse
		- Degeneration of supporting tissues (Treitz muscle)
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Anorectal venous plexus
		- Anal cushions (vascular and connective tissue)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Painless bright red rectal bleeding (on wiping or dripping into toilet)
			- Prolapse ("something coming out") during defecation
			- Itching, discomfort, mucus discharge
			- Pain (if thrombosed or strangulated)
		- #### Signs
			- Visible extrernal hemorrhoids (bluish if thrombosed)
			- Prolapse on Valsalva (for internal hemorrhoids)
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- According to degree
			- 1st Degree
				- Bleeding only (painless)
				- No prolapse
			- 2nd Degree
				- Per rectal bleeding with something coming out during defecation and spontaneously reposed after defecation
			- 3rd Degree
				- Per rectal bleeding with something coming out during defecation and  reposited manually
			- 4th Degree
				- Per rectal bleeding with swelling permanently outside the anal canal (strangulated or thrombosed hemorrhoids) Usually painful
		- Site
			- Internal hemorrhoids (above dentate line, painless)
			- External hemorrhoids (below dentate line, painful if thrombosed)
			- Interno-external hemorrhoids (Mixed)
		- According to Position
			- Primary Hemorrhoids
				- 3,7,11 Position
			- Secondary Hemorrhoids
				- Hemorrhoids occur between Primary Hemorrhoids
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- History + Digital Rectal Examination(DRE) + Proctoscopy (3,7,11 o'clcok position usually)
	- ### Investigation
		- Colonoscopy/Sigmoidoscopy if red flags (e.g., weight loss, anemia)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |Anal Fissure|Painful defecation, visible tear|
			  |Rectal Prolapse|Concentric Mucosal folds|
			  |Colorectal cancer| Colonoscopy, biopsy|
			  |Perianal abscess|Fluctuant, tender swelling|
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- According to Degree
		- 1st Degree
			- Change the dietary habit
			- Bowel softener and bowel habit change and medical treatment
			- Sclerosing agent (injection) + 5% phenol in almond oil
			- Medical Treatment : Diosmin + Hesperidin (Daflon)
			  *Symptom relief*
		- 2nd Degree
			- Bowel softener and change bowel habit
			- Banding Application
		- 3rd Degree + 4th Degree
			- Bowel softener
			- Surgery
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Milligan Morgan Haemorrhoidectomy
		- Minimal Invasive Surgery Stapled Haemorrhoidopexy (LONGO)
		- Laser Surgery
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Fiber (25-30 g/day)
		- Fluids
		- Avoid Straining
	- ### Follow-up
		- Post-op : Monitor for bleeding/stricture
		- Recurrence prevention via diet
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Excellent (90% + symptom relief)
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Anemia
				- Thrombosis
				- Strangulation
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Chronic prolapse
				- Incontinence(rare)
