- Cardiac Arrest Algorithm
	- Begin CPR
		- chest compressions
		- oxygen/ventilation
		- connect ECG the Defibrillator
	- check for Shockable Rhythm
		- shock if VF/pVT
			- 120-200 Joules then 2 minutes of Chest Compressions(1st round)
				- ensure IV/IO access
			- if rhythm is shockable, then shock by keep on stepping up to maximum then 2 minutes of Chest Compression(2nd round)
				- after CPR for 2 minutes, deliver first dose of Epinephrine; 1 mg IVP q3-5 min followed by 10-20 ml of flush
				- if good IV/IO access was established during 1st round of chest compression, give epinephrine at that time, don't wait until after 2nd round of compression
				- ensure
					- Advanced Airway
					- ETCO2
			- if rhythm is shockable, then shock by keep on stepping up to maximum then 2 minutes of Chest Compression(3rd round)
				- Amiodorone 300 mg IVP
					- give in 2nd round if possible...if given before, then +150 IVP
			- if rhythm is shockable, shock and repeat Chest Compression
			- after shocking, and repeating chest compressions, if rhythm is not shockable, then check for Signs of ROSC
				- if Signs of ROSC, then Post Cardiac Arrest Algorithm
		- if not shockable, PEA/Asystole
			- Chest compressions for 2 minutes
				- establish IV/IO
					- Epinephrine 1 mg IVPq3-5 min followed by 10-20 ml of flush
				- ensure
					- advanced Airway
					- ETCO2
			- chest if rhythm is shockable, then go as per shockable part of algorithm
				- if not, check if ROSC
					- if not, repeat all over, Chest Compression for 2 minutes
						- also, check and treat for any reversible causes of cardiac arrest
- Post Cardiac Arrest Algorithm
	- after ROCS
	- Optimize Ventilation/Oxygenation
		- Good airway/ Support Breathing (Advanced Airway)
		- Titrate Oxygen for sat â‰¥94% after the 100%
		- Waveform capnography / Avoid hyperventiation -> EtCO2 35-40
	- Treat Hypotension
		- if SBB <90 or MAP < 65
		- Ensure, IV/IO Access (patent/functional)
		- Fluids (1-2 L NS/LR)
		- Vasopressors (Norepi, Epi, Dopamine) -> Titrate to achieve pressure SBB > 90 and MAP > 65
		  *bare minimum is also, okay*
	- Identify & Treat Underlying Causes
	- 12 Lead ECG to acess of (STEMI/AMI)
		- if yes, then PCI
		- if no, then check following of verbal commands
			- if no, [[Targeted Temperature Management]]
	- After everything, transfer the patient to ICU
