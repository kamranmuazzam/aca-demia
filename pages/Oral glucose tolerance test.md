alias:: OGTT

- Objective : assessment of endogenenous insulin response to Physiological glucose chalange
- # Indications of OGTT
	- |FBG|RPG|During Pregnancy|
	  |--|--|--|
	  |3.1-7.0 mmol/L[:br]110-126 mg/dl|7.8-11.0 mmol/L[:br]140-198 mg/dl|Excessive wt. gaining is noticed[:br]with past g baby 4 kg or more, or past history of miscarriage|
- # Preparation of the patients of OGTT
	- The  patient is instructed to have unrestricted carbohydrate diet (>150 gm) for 3 days prior to the test
	  unrestricted:: meaning normal diet, no less, no more
	- patients should avoid drugs likely to influence the blood glucose levels (oral antidiabetic drugs, steroids, and oral contraceptive) for at least 2 days prior to the test
	- Strenuous exercise on the previous day is to be avoided
	- Patient neither should take food after 8 PM. The previous night nor should be breakfast > This  ensure 12 hours fasting
	- Avoidance of smoking and exercise prior to the test
	- Sample of  blood collected in the  fasting state by venipuncture. Urine sample is also obtained > this is denoted as the "0" hour sample
- # Procedure
	- Collection of fasting  blood sample in the morning after previous overnight fasting  (8-10 hours) & estimation of fasting blood glucose
	- Intake of 75 gm glucose or 1 gm/Kg orally in 300 ml water after 5 minutes of fasting sample collection
		- for children, 1.75 gm/Kg
	- At the end of 2 hrs of oral glucose intake. Another blood sample is collected for estimation of glucose
	- Urine test for glucose
		- Testing of urine for glucose is the usual procedure for detecting DM . But it has no diagnostic value because DM may exist without glycosuria if blood glucose level does not exceed the renal threshold
		- Sometimes there may be glycosuria in absence of DM> Example : Renal glycosuria, alimentary glycosuria
