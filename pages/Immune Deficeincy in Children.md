	- -- Brutorr agammaglobulinemia
	- - x linked
	- - infx start @ 6-9 mo (why?)
	- Labs? Absence of B cells on flow cytometry, low levels of all Igs
- 17 y/o F with decreased levels of IgG, IgM, IgE and IgA but normal number of B cells
	- Combined variable immune deficiency (acquired)
	- Complication? Increased lymphoid tissue -> increased risk for lymphoma
- Most common  B-cell defect. Recurrent URIs, diarrhea
	- Selective IgA deficiency
	- Complication? Anaphylaxis reaction if given blood containing IgA
