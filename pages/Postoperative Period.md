  id:: 67a75be2-14a2-4db1-8090-880ee5c47591
	- **Maintenance Fluids**:
		- Daily requirement: **2.5–3 L/day** (35–40 mL/kg/day).
		- Example: **1 L of 0.9% saline + 1.5 L of 5% dextrose**.
	- IV fluids
		- 1st post-operative day : 5% Dextrose in Aqua
		- 2nd post-operative day : Dextrose in Normal Saline
		- 3rd post-operative day : Dextrose in Normal Saline with added K+ (60 mmol/30ml)
	- |Day|Fluid|Rationale|
	  |--|--|--|
	  |1st Post operative Day|Dextrose in Aqua|Only Nutrition and Water[:br][:br]No need for electrolytes as it is released in during surgery|
	  |2nd Post operative Day|Dextrose Normal Saline|Nutrition, water and Electrolytes|
	  |3rd Post operative Day|Dextrose Normal Saline with K+ (60 mmol/30 ml)|Nutrition, water and Electroltes with Potassium if hypokalemia|
	- ## If Hypokalemia develops
		- |Hypokalemia|Correction|
		  |--|--|
		  |Mild Hypokalemia(3-3.5 mmol/L)|Oral correction by green cocnut water, fruit juice, banana, tomato orange etc|
		  |Moderate hypokalemia|Oral potassium suplementatio nby potassium tablet or syrup with antacid or in diluted form|
		  |Severe hypokalaemia|40 mmol of KCl with 1 L normal saline for 8 hourly intravenous|
		- Also Monitor
			- ECG monitoring
			- Urine output
			- Level of K+ should be checked daily
