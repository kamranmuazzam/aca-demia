# Eponym
	- erythro is for red
	- called cell because
		- has a definite life span which is about 120 days
		- It is the mostly highly adapted cell
		- It can perform all the metabolic activities of its own with the help of enzymes
- # Concentration of RBC
	- men―5,200,000 (±300,000) /cm³
	- women―4,700,000 (±300,000) /cm³
	- ganong
		- adult male : 5-5.5 million / cu mm of blood
		- adult female : 4.5-5 million / cu mm of blood
		- infant : 6-7 million / cu mm of blood
			- because of high bone marrow content
		- fetus : 7.8 million / cu mm of blood
- # Morphology
	- circular, non-nucleated, bi-concave disc
	- shape : biconcave, circular discs
		- importance (bi-concave)
			- large surface area
				- can accomodate excess/much fluid in hypotonic solution and resist osmotic fragility
				- large surface area for storage of large amount  of hemoglobin
			- can be deformed into any shape
			- great excess of cell membrane, deformation does not cause hemolysis
	- diameter―7.8 µm (6.5-8.8 µm)
	- thickness
		- maximum―2.5 µm
			- at the periphery
		- minimum―1 µm
			- in the center
	- volume
		- 90-95 µm³
		- 80‒94 µm³
	- surface area : 140 µm²
	- life span : 120 days
	- nucleus : non nucleated
		- importance
			- provide extra space for storage of large amount of hemoglobin
			- provide special ability to change its shape  while passing through capillaries
			- prevent hemolysis by maintaining the strength of membrane
				- while changing shape while passing through capillaries
				- upto a certain limit in hypotonic solution
- # Functions
	- ...
		- the major function of RBC is to contain Hb which in turn carries $\ce{O2}$  from lung to the tissues and $\ce{CO2}$  from tissue to lung
		- It has buffering power and regulates the acid-base balance. RBC is responsible for as much as 50% of all the buffering reaction of the whole blood
		- RBC helps to maintain the viscosity of the blood
		- By special permeability of cell membrane, RBC helps to maintain the balance between positive & negative ions in the blood
		- RBC cell membrane contain specific substance or antigen which determine blood group of an individual
		- RBC contain hemoglobin. Thus they act as a store house of 2/3 of total blood protein
		- Various pigments are derived from Hb after the breakdown of RBC. eg. Bilirubin, Biliverdin
	- transport of  Oxygen and Carbon dioxide to and from the lungs
	- It regulates acid-base balance
		- Haemoglobin in the cells are responsible for most of the acid-base buffer in the blood
	- RBC helps to maintain the viscosity of blood
	- RBC membrane contain group specific antigens which determine blood group
	- By special permeability of cell membrane, RBC help to maintain the balance between positive and negative ions in the blood
	- carbonic anhydrase catalyse the formation of carbonic acid
		- Contain large quantities of *carbonic anhydrase*
		- catalyses the reversible reaction increasing the rate of this reaction several thousand fold
			- [\ce{CO2 + H2O ->[Carbonic anhydrase] H2CO3}](https://www.remnote.com/doc/TiMcE88CihkRaJMNi?isPin=false)
			- making it possible for transport of large amounts of $\ce{CO2}$ in the form of $\ce{HCO3-}$
- [[Erythropoiesis]]
- fate of RBC | Normal Red Cell Destruction and Haemoglobin Breakdown (write all the reactions in chemical form)
	- RBC after 120 days
	- become fragile
	- release hemoglobin
	- hemoglobin engulf by macrophages of reticuloendothelial system (tissue macrophage system)
	- inside macrophages Hb ring opens. The substance(opened Hb ring)  is known as choleglobin
	- Haptogobin
		- Haptoglobins are proteins present in normal plasma capable of binding haemoglobin. The haemoglobin haptoglobin complex is removed from plasma by the RE system.
