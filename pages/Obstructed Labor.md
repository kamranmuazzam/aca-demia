- #definition Obstructed Labor is one where in spite of good uterine contractions, the progressive descent of the presenting part is arrested due to mechanical obstruction #obs-prof-card

  ICD-11_Code::
  tags:: #Disease
- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
  - ### Causative Agents #obs-prof-card
    collapsed:: true
    - Fault in the passage
      - Bony : Cephalopelvic disproportion
      - Soft tissue obstructions
        - Cervical Dystocia due to prolapse or previous operative scarring
        - Certical or broad ligament fibroid
        - Impacted ovarian tumor or the nongravid horn of bicornuate uterus below the presenting part
    - Fault in the passanger
      - Transverse lie
      - Brow presentation
      - Congenital malformations of hte fetus-hydrocephalus(commonest), fetal ascites, double monsters
      - Big baby, occipitoposterior position
      - Compound presentation
      - Locked twins

  background-color:: blue
  - ### Medical Management
    - Fluid Electrolyte Balance and correction of dehydration and ketoacidosis
    - A vaginal swab is taken and sent for culture and sensitivity test
    - Blood sample is sent for group and cross matching and a bottle of blood should be at hand prior to any operative intervention
    - Antibiotic: [[ceftriaxone]] 1 g IV is administered
    - IV infusion, [[metronidazole]] is given for anaerobic infection
  - ### Obstetric management
    - [[Vaginal Delivery]]
      - The baby is invariably dead in most of the neglected cases and destructive operative operation is the best choice to relieve the obstruction
      - If the head is low down and vaginal delivery is not risky, forceps extraction may be done in a living baby
    - Cesarean Section
      - If the case is detected early with good fetal condition, [[Caesarean Section]] gives the best result
