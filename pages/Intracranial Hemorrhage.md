- # Presentation
	- History of Trauma to Head with loss of consciousness with Lucid Interval
	- Later patient presents with confusion, irritability, hemiparesis on same side of the injury.
	- Initially pupillary constriction is due to irritation of the ipsilateral 3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor) by the herniation of the termporal lobe at the tentorial hiatus. But eventually pupillary dilatation 3rd cranial nerve. There is ischemia of the nucleus of 3rd nerve at midbrain due to compression of the posterior cerebral artery. So, burr hole decompression is done on the side of Hutchinsinian pupil
	- Features of raised intracranial pressure like high blood pressure, bradycardia, vomiting is also seen. Occasionally, convulsions may be present.
	- Wound and haematoma in the temporal region of scalp may be seen.
	- Glasgow coma scale gives clear idea about the neuronal injury.
	- Autonomic disturbances with bradycardia, systolic hypertension, deep, slow respiration and later Cheyne Stokes ventilation. Cushing's triad of raised intracranial pressure is obvious

	- Features like-restlessness, irritability, headache, vomiting, progressive deterioration are common.
- # Management
	- Should be treated in neuro ICU
	- Patient should be in 15ยบ head up position to prevent cerebral edema
	- Cervical neck collar given but not too tight
	- Monitoring of vitals : pulse, BP, electrolyte, urine output
	- Half hourly GCS monitoring
	- Nutrition maintenance
	- Osmotic diuretics - 20% mannitol drip
	- Anticonvulsant drugs
	- Do not sedate the patient
	- If patient deteriorate - craniotomy should be done
	- Surgery
		- Burrhole
		- Craniotomy - identify the bleeding vessel and ligate, remove the hematoma.
