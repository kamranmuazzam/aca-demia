	- Fetal Surface of Placenta
	  alias:: Chorionic Plate
	  id:: 6720956a-88ee-4065-9540-d90dd70e07bb
		- 4/5 of placenta
		- From within outward
			- Primitive mesenchymal tissue containing branches of umbilical vessels
			- a layer of cytotrophoblast
			- syncytiotrophoblast
		- Stem villi
			- fetal cotyledon
			  alias:: placentome
			  id:: 6720b845-df5f-42db-9348-0e914038cbf3
				- derived from primary stem villus
				- These stem villi pass down the intervillious space to anchor onto the basal plate.
			- lobule
				- Functional subunit is called a lobule, which is derived from a tertiary stem villi
				- about 60 stem villi persist in the human placenta
				- Thus, each ((6720b845-df5f-42db-9348-0e914038cbf3))(total 15-29) contains 3-4 major stem villi.
		- Total villi surfare area varies between 10 square meters and 14 square meters.
		- Structure of Terminal Villus (outside inward)
			- outer syncytiotrophoblast
			- cytotrophoblast
			- basement membrane
			- central stroma containing fetal capillaires, primitive mesenchymal cells, connective tissue and a few phagocytic( ((6720b98a-9013-4f96-a09a-80d0a5eb06ad)) ) cells
	- Maternal Surface of Placenta
	  id:: 67209f3f-5fdf-4fa5-ae57-3d0ad54b82f9
	  alias:: Basal Plate
		- Formed by remnant of decidua basalis (statrum compactum and stratum spongiosum)
		- 1/5 of placenta
		- From outside inwards
			- Part of the compact and spongy layer of the decidua basalis
			- Nitabuch's layer of fibrinoid degeneration of the outer syncytiotorophoblast at the junction of the cytotrophoblastic shell and decidua
			- Cytotrophoblastic shell
			- Syncytiotrophoblast
		- Hofbauer cells
		  id:: 6720b98a-9013-4f96-a09a-80d0a5eb06ad
			- Basement membrane of endometrium becomes thicker and the stroma contains dilated vessels along with all the constituents and few Hofbauer cells
			- Hofbauer cells are round cells taht are capable of phagocytosis and can trap maternal antibodies crossing through the placenta(immunosuppressive).
			- These cells can express class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules
	- Intervillous Space
		- Between the Chorionic Plate and Basal Plate  lies the intervillous space containing the stem villi with their branches, the space being filled with maternal blood
	- Margin
		- Peripherally, the ((6720956a-88ee-4065-9540-d90dd70e07bb)) and ((67209f3f-5fdf-4fa5-ae57-3d0ad54b82f9)) fuse together
	- Attachment
		- attached to the upper part of the body of the uterus
