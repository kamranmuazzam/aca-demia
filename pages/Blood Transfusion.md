# Common Transfused Products #gs-prof-card
	- **Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)**: Concentrated red cells with most of the plasma removed. Used to treat anemia and blood loss.
	- **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**: Contains clotting factors. Used in coagulopathies, liver disease, and massive transfusion.
	- **Cryoprecipitate**: Rich in fibrinogen, Factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor. Used in bleeding disorders like hemophilia and DIC.
	- **Platelets**: Used in thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction to prevent or treat bleeding.
	- **Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCC)**: Contains clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Used for rapid reversal of warfarin-induced bleeding.
	- **Albumin**: Used in hypovolemia, burns, and hypoalbuminemia.
	- **Granulocytes**: Rarely used, but may be given in severe neutropenia with infection.
	- **Whole Blood**: Contains all blood components (red cells, plasma, platelets). It is rarely used now, except in cases of acute massive blood loss.
	- **Autologous Blood**: Patientâ€™s own blood, collected preoperatively for transfusion during surgery.

- # Massive Blood Transfusion
	- ## Massive Blood transfusion is defined as #gs-prof-card
		- Replacement of one blood volume (approximately 5-6 liters in adults) within 24 hours or
		- >500 ml over 5 minutes
		- > 1/6 the patient's blood volume in 6 hours
		- Transfusion of >10 units of RCC in 24 hours, or
		- Transfusion of >4 units of RCC in 1 hour when ongoing blood loss is anticipated
	- ## Precautions During Massive Blood Transfusion #gs-prof-card
		- Proper screening and cross-matching
		- Use of Blood Warmers and Keep the patient warm to prevent hypothermia
		- Slower Rate of Transfusion
		- Calcium Supplementation
		- Monitor
			- Coagulation Profile and platelet count regularly
			- Electrolytes
			- Complications
		- Avoid Fluid Overload
