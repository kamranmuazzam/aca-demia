# Common Transfused Products #gs-prof-card
	- **Whole Blood**: Contains all blood components (red cells, plasma, platelets). It is rarely used now, except in cases of acute massive blood loss.
	- **Packed Red Blood Cells (PRBCs)**: Concentrated red cells with most of the plasma removed. Used to treat anemia and blood loss.
	- **Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP)**: Contains clotting factors. Used in coagulopathies, liver disease, and massive transfusion.
	- **Cryoprecipitate**: Rich in fibrinogen, Factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor. Used in bleeding disorders like hemophilia and DIC.
	- **Platelets**: Used in thrombocytopenia or platelet dysfunction to prevent or treat bleeding.
	- **Prothrombin Complex Concentrates (PCC)**: Contains clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. Used for rapid reversal of warfarin-induced bleeding.
	- **Albumin**: Used in hypovolemia, burns, and hypoalbuminemia.
	- **Granulocytes**: Rarely used, but may be given in severe neutropenia with infection.
	- **Autologous Blood**: Patientâ€™s own blood, collected preoperatively for transfusion during surgery.

- # Management of Mismatched Blood Transfusion #gs-prof-card
	- Stop the Transfusion Immediately
	- Maintain IV Access with Normal Saline to ensure adequate hydration
	- Send Blood Samples to lab for
		- Repeat cross-matching
		- Direct Coombs test
		- Serum bilirubin, hemoglobin, haptoglobin
		- Urine for hemoglobin
	- Monitor Vital Signs : Blood pressure, pulse, urine output
	- Administer Medications
		- Diuretics (e.g., furosemide) to maintain urine output
		- Antihistamines and steroid to reduce allergic reactions
		- Calcium Gluconate if hypocalcemia is suspected (due to citrate toxicity)
	- Treat Renal Failure: If oliguria persists, consider dialysis
	- Investigate Cause: Ensure proper labelling and cross-matching procedures were followed
