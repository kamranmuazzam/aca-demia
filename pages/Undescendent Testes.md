- ### Common Locations (*Site of Arrest*)
  *common location is in opposite order*
  #gs-prof-card
	- Posterior Abdominal Wall(5)
	- Deep inguinal ring(6)
	- Inguinal Canal(7)
	- Superficial Inguinal Ring(8)
- if testis present  in other site then descend pathway -> [[Ectopic Testis]]
- Factors of Descent of Testis
	- Body growth
	- Testosterone
	- Gubernaculum testis
	- Body temperature
- ##### Possible Complications
	- Acute epididymo orchitis
	- Torsion testes
	- Inguinal hernia
	- Infertility (in bilateral case)
	- Malignancy
- Investigation
	- USG of abdomen to find undescended testis
	- CT scan to find undescended testis
	- MRI scan to find undescended testis
	- Diagnostic Laparotomy
	- If Bilateral, do hormone studies of Testosterone, LH, FSH -> if reduced Testosterone, it means gonadal agenesis
- Treatment
	- Descend of testes by Orchidopexy (open/laproscopy or combined)
		- Mobilization + Fixation
	- Fowler-Stephens Orchidopexy
		- 2 Stage Orchidopexy
			- Stage I : Ligation and cut of testicular artery
			  *this allows the development of collateral circulation*
			- Stage II : after 6 months, orchidopexy
	- Best time for treatment
		- 6 months - 1 year
			- reason
				- possible spontaneous descent within 6 months
				- spermatogonia count doesn't decrease until first 6 months
				- less chance of complications
- Differential -> [[Retractile Testis]]
	- due to activity of cremasteric muscle, testis goes to inguinal canal
	- to rule out -> patient is sat in squatting position, testis comes back
