alias:: Congenital Talipes Equinovarus, CTEV, Talipes
ICD-11_Code:: LB74.0 (Congenital talipes equinovarus)
tags:: disease, developmental disease, orthopedics

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Unknown, but likely multifactorial (genetic + environmental)
		- Possible in utero mechanical constraints (oligohydromnios, abnormal positioning)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Family history (polygenic inheritance)
		- Male sex (2:1 male-to-female ration)
		- Smoking during pregnancy
		- Neuromuscular disorders (spina bifida, arthrogryposis)
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- ~1-2 per 1,000 live births (unilateral ~40% of cases)
	- ### Prevalence
		- ### Demographics
			- More common in males, first born children
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- No significant variation; seen worldwide
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Abnormal development of bones, muscles, and tendons in the foot (medial displacement of navicular, shortened Achilees tendon)
		- Possible primary neurogenic or myogenic etiology
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Musculoskeletal (foot and ankle deformity)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Foot turned  inward and downward at birth (fixed deformity)
			- Painless in infancy, but walking difficulties if untreated
		- #### Signs
			- "CAVE" deformity
				- ![E-RbeJ5XIAEdQfO.jpg](../assets/E-RbeJ5XIAEdQfO_1746426894381_0.jpg)
				- Cavus : Exaggerated Medial Longitudinal arch (midfoot)
				- Adductus : Forefoot in adduction in tarsometatarsal junction
				- Varus : Hind foot roated inward at talocalcaneonavicular joint
				- Equinus : Foot fixed in plantar flexion at ankle joint
			- Smaller Foot size on affected side (unilateral cases)
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Pirani Score (0-6, severity scale)
		- Dimeglio Classification (mild to very severe)
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Prenatal ultrasound (late trimester)
		- Clinical, Physical exam
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Prenatal ultrasound (late trimester)
			- Postnatal X-ray/USG (limited role; clinical diagnosis is primary)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |Postural clubfoot|Flexible, correctable manually|
			  |Arthrogryposis| Multiple joint contractures|
			  Neuromuscular CTEV| Associated neurological deficits|
		- ### General Assessment
			- Imaging for severe/atypical cases
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Conservative Treatment
		- Ponseti Method (gold standard) : Serial casting + Achilles tenotomy (90% success)
			- Serial casting
				- When: Begins 1-2 weeks after birth (optimal window)
				- Technique
					- Weekly gentle manipulation + long-leg casts
					- Corrects components in order : Cavus -> Adductus -> Varus -> Equinus
					- Average : 5-7 casts (varies by severity)
				- Never force correction; gradual repositioning avoids tissue damage
				  background-color:: red
			- Achilles Tenotomy (percutaneous)
				- When : After cavus/adductus/varus are corrected (usually final cast)
				- Why : Address residual Equinus (Achilles tendon is too tight for dorsiflexion)
				- Procedure : Minor outpatient surgery (local anesthesia; heals in 3 weeks)
			- Bracing Phase (Maintenance)
				- When : Immediately after tenotomy (final cast for 3 weeks -> transition to brace)
				- Protocol
					- Full-time bracing (23/hrs/day) for 3 months
					- Night time bracing (12-14 hours/day) until age 4-5 years
				- Brace Type : Foot Abduction Brace (FAB; Mitchell-Ponseti bar with shoes)
				- Purpose : Prevents relapse (critical for long-term success)
			- | **Stage** | **Timing** |
			  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
			  | **Serial Casting** | Start at 1–2 weeks old; weekly. |
			  | **Achilles Tenotomy** | ~6–8 weeks old (after casts). |
			  | **Full-time Bracing** | 3 months post-tenotomy. |
			  | **Night-time Bracing** | Until age 4–5 years. |
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Posteromedial release (for resistant cases)
		- Osteotomies (older children with residual deformity)
	- ### Follow-up
		- Long-term (until skeletal maturity) to monitor relapse
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- 90% achieve functional, pain-free foot
			- May require bracing until age 4-5 years
			- **Relapse Risk**: Highest in first 2–3 years (often due to non-compliance with bracing).
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- painful gait, arthriitis, calluses
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Permanent disability, social stigma
- ## Prevention
  background-color:: blue
	- No primary prevention; genetic coounselling for familial cases
