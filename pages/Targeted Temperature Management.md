alias:: Therapeutic Hypothermia, Hypothermia Protocol

- when neurologic response is less after Cardiac Arrest we actively cool the patient to preserve neurologic function to increase outcomes
- Believed to decrease cerebral metabolic demand leading to decreased oxygen consumption leading to decreased ATP demand.
- Believed that this leads to decreased excitatory neurotransmitters to prevent neuronal cell death
- Believed to decrease cerebral edema to decrease permeability of BB and decrease CBF leading to decrease in ICP
- # Indication
	- Post Cardiac Arrest
	  *works best in patients with non-schockable rythms but general rule is to apply to all post cardiac arrests, shockable and non-shockable alike*
		- Within 6 hours of arrest
	- Comatose, GCS < 8
- # Contraindication
	- don't cool below 35 ºC for patients having bleeding disorders
- # Stages
	- ## Cooling/Induction
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Achieve Target Temperature, as quickly as possible
		- ### Techniques
			- #### External
				- Icepacks, cool/wet towels, **cooling devices**
				- wraps, pads, mattress
			- #### Internal
				- Intravascular/Endovascular
				- Cold IVF, ice water lavage
				- **Intravascular catheter**
				- Extracorporeal (ECMO/CRRT)
			- Both require core temperature feedback (foley, rectal, esophageal, PA cath)
		- The targeted temperature is not concluded yet, but 36ºC is supported by evidence and further to 33ºC doesn't show any benefits
		- The duration is 24 hours
	- ## Rewarming
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Current recommendations to increase 0.2-0.5 ºC /hr
		- During rewarming patient is at risk for
			- Hypotension
			- Hyperkalemia
			- Hypoglycemia
		- Once rewarmed, maintain 37 ºC using cooling devices for 48 hours
- # Complications
	- Regaining Consciousness
		- before completion of Treatment patient might regain Consciousness, in this case we end the treatment
	- Shivering
		- Body's natural response to stay warm
		- Slow rate, harder to maintina
		- Typically occurs w/changing temps
		- Treatment
			- Cutaneous warming (face, hands/feet)
			- 4g MgSO4 (this increases shivering threshold)
			- Analgesic/Sedation (bolus vs infusion)
			- Paralytics (bolus vs infusion)
	- Diuresis
		- Mild cold diuresis w/ electrolyte wasting
		- Hypovolemia
		- Electrolyte imbalances
			- decreased K, decreased Mg, decreased Ca
			- frequent check labs -> replace
			- Rewarming reverse K flux, hence we will hold replacement 4 hours prior to rewarming
	- Insulin
		- decreased secretion and sensitivity leading to Hyperglycemia
	- Fever
		- Rebound fever with rewarming
	- Bleeding
		- Temperature impact clotting
			- 35 ºC+ : no impact
			- 33-35 ºC : mild impair platelet
			- < 33 ºC : platelets clot cascades
			- < 30 ºC : Significant effect with risk for bleeding
	- Compromised Immune System
		- leading to risk of infection esp. VAP
		  *to combat this 2 day prophylaxis with ampicillin and salbactum*
	- Arrhythmias
		- Bradycardia is common and not treated unless hemodynamic comes into effect
		- Afib/ Vtach, treat as per protocol
	- Skin Compromise
		- decrease blood flow to skin can lead to skin breakdown and increase external cooling
		- use moisturizers
