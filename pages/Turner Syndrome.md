alias:: Monosomy X, 45.X  
ICD-11_Code:: LD50.0  
tags:: disease, genetic disorder, chromosomal abnormality

- ## Etiology  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Complete or partial absence of one X chromosome (45,X or mosaicism).
		- Structural abnormalities of the X chromosome (e.g., isochromosome Xq, ring X).
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Sporadic; no known inherited risk factors.
		- Advanced maternal age is **not** a significant risk factor (unlike autosomal trisomies).
- ## Epidemiology  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- ~1 in 2,000–2,500 live female births.
	- ### Prevalence
		- Underdiagnosed due to mild phenotypes in some cases.
		- ### Demographics
			- Exclusively affects females.
			- Mosaicism (e.g., 45,X/46,XX) may lead to milder presentations.
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- No significant geographic variation; occurs worldwide.
- ## Pathophysiology  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Haploinsufficiency of X-linked genes (e.g., *SHOX* gene → short stature).
		- Ovarian dysgenesis due to accelerated oocyte loss.
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- **Reproductive**: Ovarian failure (infertility in ~95%).
		- **Cardiovascular**
			- **Aortic root dilation leading to aortic dissection/rupture**
			- Bicuspid aortic valve
			- coarctation of the aorta.
		- **Endocrine**: Hypothyroidism, glucose intolerance.
		- **Skeletal**: Short stature, scoliosis, osteoporosis.
		- **Renal**: Horseshoe kidney, abnormal renal positioning
- ## Clinical Features  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Delayed puberty (primary amenorrhea).
			- Short stature (most common feature).
			- Learning difficulties (e.g., spatial reasoning deficits).
		- #### Signs
			- Webbed neck, low hairline, widely spaced nipples.
			- Lymphedema (in newborns).
			- Cubitus valgus (wide carrying angle of arms).
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- **Classic Turner Syndrome**: 45,X karyotype.
		- **Mosaic Turner Syndrome**: 45,X/46,XX or 45,X/46,XY.
- ## Diagnosis  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical features + karyotype confirmation (peripheral blood or amniocentesis).
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- **Karyotyping** (gold standard).
			- **Prenatal**: Ultrasound findings (e.g., cystic hygroma, cardiac defects).
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis  
		  | DD                | Ruling Out                          |  
		  |-------------------|-----------------------------------|  
		  | Noonan Syndrome   | Normal karyotype, *PTPN11* mutation |  
		  | Prader-Willi      | Hypomethylation at 15q11-q13       |
		- ### General Assessment
			- Echocardiogram, renal ultrasound, thyroid function tests.
- ## Management and Treatment  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- **Growth hormone therapy** (initiated in childhood).
		  *usually around 4-6 years*
		- **Estrogen replacement** (starting at ~12 years for puberty induction).
			- Start with **low-dose estrogen alone** → gradually increase dose(every 6 months to reach adult dose in 2-3 years) → after 1–2 years or first bleeding, add **cyclical progesterone**(14 days per month).
			- If diagnosis at this age then GH has limited benefits, if growth plates haven't closed then trial can be performed
			- Even if diagnosis is late, say age 20, Estrogen therapy is still indicated
			- once secondary sexual characteristics develop as per adult then patient can swtich to OCP, but it poses Cardiovascular risks so Comorbidities and Safety profile should be checked first
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Cardiac surgery for aortic coarctation.
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Calcium/vitamin D supplementation for bone health.
		- Regular exercise to prevent obesity.
	- ### Follow-up
		- Annual cardiac, thyroid, and hearing assessments.
			- Cardiac : Echocardiographhy
				- Repeat imaging every 5-10 years if stable, or more frequently if abnormalities(e.g., aortic dilation) or hypertension are present
				- MRI may be used for detailed aortic assessment
- ## Prognosis  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Near-normal height with growth hormone.
			- Improved quality of life with hormone replacement.
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Aortic dissection, osteoporosis, infertility.
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Increased risk of autoimmune disorders (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).
	- ### Survival Rates
		- Near-normal lifespan with proactive management.
			- Death due to cardiovascular complications
				- Bicuspid aortic valve
				- Aortic Dissection
				- Coarctation of Aorta
	- ### Quality of Life Considerations
		- Psychosocial support for body image/fertility concerns.
- ## Prevention  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Health Education
		- Genetic counseling for families.
	- ### Screening Programs
		- Increased [[Nuchal Translucency]] in 1st trimester
		- Prenatal ultrasound + karyotyping for high-risk pregnancies.
		- FISH for newborn with suspected features like lymphedema of hands and feet.
- ## Patient Education and Support  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Support Groups
		- Turner Syndrome Society (e.g., [TSSUS](https://www.turnersyndrome.org)).
	- ### Counseling Options
		- Reproductive counseling (egg donation/surrogacy options).
