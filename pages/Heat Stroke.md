alias:: Sunstroke, Thermic Fever
ICD-11_Code:: NF01.0
tags:: disease, emergency, environmental

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Prolonged exposure to high temperatures (classic heat stroke)
		- Strenuous physical activity in hot environments (exertional heat stroke)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Dehydration
		- Advanced age (classic) or young age (exertional)
		- Chronic illnesses (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes)
		- Medications
			- **diuretics**
			- **anticholinergics**
			- **beta-blockers**
			- anti-histamines
			- antispychotics
				- Can precipitate **neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)** — can mimic or coexist with heat stroke
			- sympathomimetics
		- Alcohol/drug use
		- High humidity environments
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- Varies by climate; peaks during heatwaves
	- ### Prevalence
		- ### Demographics
			- Elderly (>65 years) in non-air-conditioned homes (classic)
			- Athletes/military personnel (exertional)
		- ### Geographic Distribution
			- Higher in tropical/subtropical regions and during summer months
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Thermoregulatory failure → core temperature ≥40°C (104°F)
		- Systemic inflammatory response → multiorgan dysfunction
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- CNS (altered mental status)
		- Liver (necrosis)
			- direct thermal injury
			- early liver injury would cause coagulopathy, hypoglycemia
			- this means bad prognosis, early detection and immediate intensive care would improve prognosis
		- Muscle : [[Rhabdomyolysis]]
		- Kidneys (acute injury)
			- *Liver injury precedes Kidney Injury*
			- caused by [[Rhabdomyolysis]] -> myoglobinuria (toxic to tubules)
			- Hypovolemia/Hypotension causing ischemia
		- Coagulation (DIC), Cardiovascular (shock)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- CNS Dysfunction : Confusion, seizures, coma
			- Nausea/vomiting, headache
		- #### Signs
			- Hot, dry skin (classic) or profuse sweating (exertional)
			- Tachycardia, hypotension
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Classic (passive heat exposure) vs. Exertional (physical activity)
			- |Trait|Classic|Exertional|
			  |--|--|--|
			  |Demographics|Elderly, Chronically Ill, Very Young| Young Healthy Individuals(Athletes, Millitary|
			  |Cause|Environmental Heat Exposure during Heatwaves|Strenuous activity in hot/humid conditions|
			  |Onset|gradual(over days)|rapid(within hours)|
			  |Sweating|often absent|usually present initially|
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Core temperature ≥40°C + CNS dysfunction (e.g., delirium) in heat exposure
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Rectal/core temperature measurement
			- Labs: Elevated creatinine, transaminases, CK; coagulopathy

			- Electrolytes
				- Hyponatremia
				- [[Hyperkalemia]]
				- Metabolic Acidosis
			- [[Myoglobinuria]]
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Principles
		- Immediate Rapid Cooling
		- Supportive Care (Airway, Fluids, Organ Support)
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Rapid cooling
		  *Aim to lower to 39 degrees*
			- Exertional : [[Ice Bath]]
			- Classical : For elderly
				- evaporative cooling (Spraying + Fan)
				- Ice packs to axillae, groin, neck
		- IV fluids (caution in elderly/cardiac patients)
		- Benzodiazepines for seizures
		  *After cooling to 39 degrees shivering may kick in as a thermogenic response paradoxically raising temperature *
	- ### Surgical Options
		- N/A (unless complications require intervention)
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Hydration, avoid alcohol/caffeine in heat
	- ### Follow-up
		- Monitor CK, K+ and Renal function
			- *Rhabdomyolysis is often silent early but deadly if missed*
		- Monitor for organ dysfunction recurrence
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Recovery in 24–48 hours if cooled promptly
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Multi-organ failure, death (mortality up to 50%)
				- Most common cause of death : CNS failure (severe brain injury and cerebral edema)
