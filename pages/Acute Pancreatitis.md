	- Treatment Plan
		- Access Severity and First admit to [[ICU]] / [[DCU]]
			- Establish IV channels
			- Address Hemodynamic instability
				- if blood is required, blood grouping, Rh typing, cross matching and blood transfusion
				- if fluid electrolyte correction is required, agressive fluid electrolyte correction
			- Resuscitation by NPO
			- IV Analgesics as mentioned in ((68ad924f-6324-4ba8-9d86-1b06b2afd9c6)) below
			- NG suction
			- IV PPI
			- IV broad spectrum antibiotics
	- ### Medical Treatment In
		- Agressive fluid electrolyte correction
		- Resuscitation by NPO
		- NG suction
		- IV opiod/synthetic opiod analgesics
		- IV PPI
		- IV broad spectrum antibiotic
	- ### Pain Management for Pancreatitis
	  id:: 68ad924f-6324-4ba8-9d86-1b06b2afd9c6
		- For Severe Pain
			- Start with [[Fentanyl]] IV 25–50 mcg q10–15 min PRN or PCA (10–25 mcg demand, 6–10 min lockout) ; good in renal impairment/ hemodynamic instability
				- Check Renal Function before advancing to [[Morphine]] or [[Hydromorphone]]
					- [[Hydromorphone]] IV 0.2–0.5 mg q2–3h PRN or PCA (e.g., 0.1–0.2 mg demand, 6–10 min lockout, no basal initially).
					- [[Morphine]] IV 2–4 mg q2–4h PRN or PCA (1 mg demand, 6–10 min lockout); avoid/limit in severe renal impairment due to active metabolites.
					- [[Ondansetron]] PRN; start senna ± [[polyethylene glycol]] to prevent opioid-induced constipation
			- [[Paracetamol]] IV or PO 650–1000 mg q6–8h (max 3 g/day in most inpatients; lower in liver disease/low body weight).
			- [[NSAIDS]]: [[Ketorolac]] 15–30 mg IV q6h, max 5 days. Alternatively, [[Ibuprofen]] PO when tolerated.
		- during moderate pain, step down from opiods
			- [[Paracetamol]] IV or PO 650–1000 mg q6–8h (max 3 g/day in most inpatients; lower in liver disease/low body weight).
			- [[NSAIDS]] if safe: e.g., [[Ibuprofen]] 400–600 mg q6–8h, [[Naproxen]] 250–500 mg BID, or [[celecoxib]] 100–200 mg BID (lower GI risk).
			- Add one PRN breakthrough option:
				- [[Tramadol]] 50–100 mg q6h PRN (max 400 mg/day; watch for serotonergic drugs/seizure risk; renal/hepatic dose adjust), or
				- Short-acting opioid PRN (e.g., [[oxycodone]] 5 mg q4–6h or [[Hydromorphone]] 2 mg q4–6h). Prescribe the minimum necessary and plan to taper quickly.
			- Mild/resolving pain (pre-discharge and outpatient)
			- Aim to be opioid-free
				- [[Acetaminophen]] ± [[NSAIDS]] as above.
				- Non-pharmacologic: early enteral feeding as tolerated, hydration, treat nausea with Methoclopremide
				- If any opioids are still needed, give only a very short course with clear stop date and a laxative.
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Only in complications as
			- [[Pancreatic Pseudocyst]]
