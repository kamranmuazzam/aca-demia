	- |Grade||Features|
	  |--|--|--|
	  |Grade 1|Fluctuation|Normal Appearance and Angle Nail bed Fluctuation|
	  |Grade 2|Obliteration|Obliteration of Lovibond angle|
	  |Grade 3|Drumstick|Increased Curvature of Nails, Parrot Beak or Drumstick Appearance|
	  |Grade 4| [[HPOA]] |Swelling in all Directions [[Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy]] |
- Pathophysiology
	- Neurogenic
	- Hypoxia
		- lower oxygenation of tissue causes VEGF which increases neovasculature
	- Platelet derived growth factor
		- Megakaryocytes in normal physiology enter the pulmonary capillaries and split into smaller platelets
		- If they skip pulmonary capillaries due to Pathology of Lung, it gets clogged in the systemic capillaries, which then causes release of PDGF and VEGF
	- Mutation
		- Mutation of HPGD Gene (Autosomal Dominant)
		- Dysfunction of 15 PGDH enzyme
		- Failure to metabolize PGE2
		- Increased blood flow, and connective tissue proliferation
- Etiology #shaheen
	- Respiratory
		- Lung Cancer
		- Lung Abscess
		- Bronchiectasis
	- Cardiac
		- Infective Endocarditis
		- Tetralogy of Fallot
	- GI
		- Cirrhosis
		- [[IBD]]
	- Endocrine
		- Thyrotoxicosis
	- Congenital
		- Benign familial(harmless)
- ## Approach
	- ### History
		- #### Onset
			- Recent : Acute process
			- Long-Standing
		- #### Associated Symptoms
			- Respiratory : [[Cough]], [[Hemoptysis]], [[Dyspnea]]
			- Cardiovascular: [[Cyanosis]], [[Chest Pain]], [[Palpitations]]
			- Gastrointestinal: [[Diarrhoea]] , [[Weight Loss]], [[Jaundice]]
		- #### History of Past Illness
			- [[Chronic Lung Disease]] : [[COPD]], [[Interstitial Lung Disease]]
			- Heart Disease : [[Congenital Heart Diseases]], [[Endocarditis]]
			- Liver or GI Disease : [[Cirrhosis]], [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]]
		- #### Family History
			- Hereditary Clubbing can occur in rare cases
		- #### Personal History
			- [[Smoking History]] is strong link to lung cancer and other [[Chronic Lung Disease]]
	- ### Physical Examination
		- #### Inspection of fingers and toes
			- **Shape**: Look for "drumstick" appearance of the fingertips.
			- **Nail changes**: Curved or "floating" nails.
			- **Schamroth's sign**: Loss of the normal diamond-shaped window formed when dorsal surfaces of the opposite fingers are placed together.
			- Perform ((66ee8e35-aeb3-482f-aeb0-6e9e676f646b))
		- #### Systemic Examination
			- **Respiratory**: Look for signs of chronic lung disease, auscultate for abnormal breath sounds.
			- **Cardiovascular**: Check for signs of heart failure or cyanosis.
			- **Abdominal**: Look for hepatomegaly, ascites (indicating liver disease).
			- **Skin**: Check for signs of systemic diseases (e.g., vasculitis, erythema nodosum).
