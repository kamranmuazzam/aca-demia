definition:: It is the bulbous enlargement of the terminal phalanges due to proliferation of connective tissue.

	  |Grade 1|Fluctuation|Normal Appearance and Angle Nail bed Fluctuation|
	  |Grade 2|Obliteration|Obliteration of Lovibond angle|
	  |Grade 3|Drumstick|Increased Curvature of Nails, Parrot Beak or Drumstick Appearance|
	  |Grade 4| [[HPOA]] |Swelling in all Directions [[Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy]] |
- Pathophysiology
	- Neurogenic
	- Hypoxia
		- lower oxygenation of tissue causes VEGF which increases neovasculature
	- Platelet derived growth factor
		- Megakaryocytes in normal physiology enter the pulmonary capillaries and split into smaller platelets
		- If they skip pulmonary capillaries due to Pathology of Lung, it gets clogged in the systemic capillaries, which then causes release of PDGF and VEGF
	- Mutation
		- Mutation of HPGD Gene (Autosomal Dominant)
		- Dysfunction of 15 PGDH enzyme
		- Failure to metabolize PGE2
		- Increased blood flow, and connective tissue proliferation
- Etiology
	- Respiratory
		- Bronchial Carcinoma (more commonly large cell than small cell)
		- Chronic suppurative lung disease
			- Bronchiectasis
			- Lung Abscess
			- Chronic empyema
		- Pulmonary Fibrosis
			- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
			- Cystic fibrosis
			- Fibrosing Alveolitis
		- Asbestosis
		- Sarcoidosis
	- Cardiac
		- Fallot Tetralogy
		- Eisenmenger Syndrome
		- Subactute Bacterial Endocarditis
		- Left Atrial Myxoma
	- GI
		- [[IBD]]
		- Cirrhosis
		- Coliac Disease
		- GI Lymphoma
		- PBC
	- Idiopathic
		- Familial usually before puberty
	- Rare
		- Thyroid Acropachy
		- Pregnancy
		- Unilateral clubbing
		- Bronchial arteovenous aneurysm
		- Axillary artery aneurysm
- ## Approach
	- ### History
		- #### Onset
			- Recent : Acute process
			- Long-Standing
		- #### Associated Symptoms
			- Respiratory : [[Cough]], [[Hemoptysis]], [[Dyspnea]]
			- Cardiovascular: [[Cyanosis]], [[Chest Pain]], [[Palpitations]]
			- Gastrointestinal: [[Diarrhoea]] , [[Weight Loss]], [[Jaundice]]
		- #### History of Past Illness
			- [[Chronic Lung Disease]] : [[COPD]], [[Interstitial Lung Disease]]
			- Heart Disease : [[Congenital Heart Diseases]], [[Endocarditis]]
			- Liver or GI Disease : [[Cirrhosis]], [[Inflammatory Bowel Disease]]
		- #### Family History
			- Hereditary Clubbing can occur in rare cases
		- #### Personal History
			- [[Smoking History]] is strong link to lung cancer and other [[Chronic Lung Disease]]
	- ### Physical Examination
		- #### Inspection of fingers and toes
			- **Shape**: Look for "drumstick" appearance of the fingertips.
			- **Nail changes**: Curved or "floating" nails.
			- **Schamroth's sign**: Loss of the normal diamond-shaped window formed when dorsal surfaces of the opposite fingers are placed together.
			- Perform ((66ee8e35-aeb3-482f-aeb0-6e9e676f646b))
		- #### Systemic Examination
			- **Respiratory**: Look for signs of chronic lung disease, auscultate for abnormal breath sounds.
			- **Cardiovascular**: Check for signs of heart failure or cyanosis.
			- **Abdominal**: Look for hepatomegaly, ascites (indicating liver disease).
			- **Skin**: Check for signs of systemic diseases (e.g., vasculitis, erythema nodosum).
