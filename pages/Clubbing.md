definition:: It is the bulbous enlargement of the terminal phalanges due to proliferation of connective tissue.

- Pathophysiology
	- Neurogenic
	- Hypoxia
		- lower oxygenation of tissue causes VEGF which increases neovasculature
	- Platelet derived growth factor
		- Megakaryocytes in normal physiology enter the pulmonary capillaries and split into smaller platelets
		- If they skip pulmonary capillaries due to Pathology of Lung, it gets clogged in the systemic capillaries, which then causes release of PDGF and VEGF
	- Mutation
		- Mutation of HPGD Gene (Autosomal Dominant)
		- Dysfunction of 15 PGDH enzyme
		- Failure to metabolize PGE2
		- Increased blood flow, and connective tissue proliferation
- Etiology
	- Respiratory
		- Bronchial Carcinoma (more commonly large cell than small cell)
		- Chronic suppurative lung disease
			- Bronchiectasis
