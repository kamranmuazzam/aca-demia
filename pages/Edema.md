- #definition excessive accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces
- ## Pathophysiology
	- The balance of forces within the capillary
		- Arterial End
			- Hydrostatic Pressure : 35 mm Hg
			- Osmotic Pressure : 25 mm Hg
			- Net Pressure : 10 mm Hg
		- Venous End
			- Hydrostatic Pressure : 18 mm Hg
			- Osmotic Pressure : 25 mm Hg
			- Net Pressure : -7 mm Hg
		- Lymphatic Suction
			- It is clear that at the arterial end the fluid exits the capillaries while at the venous end the fluid enters the capillaries, but the driving pressure in between arterial and venous ends is not in equilibrium
			- So, a net pressure at which fluid is exiting the capillaries is at 3 mm Hg
			- This excessive fluid is taken by the lymphatic system by it's suction pressure varying from 0 to -3.7 mm Hg
- ## Etiopathology
	- Increased Hydrostatic Pressure

		- Decreased Arterial Resistance
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- This might seem counterintuitive, but the arteriole diameter is widely dilated if arterial resistance is decreased(the mean arterial pressure is decreased) which in turn creates more pressure while passing from an overly dilated arteriole to narrow capillaries
