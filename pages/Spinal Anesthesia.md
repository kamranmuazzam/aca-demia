alias:: Subarachnoid Block, SAB

- It involves injecting a local anesthetic into the subarachnoid space (containing cerebrospinal fluid) to block nerve roots, providing anesthesia and muscle relaxation for surgeries below the level of the injection. It is commonly used for procedures like cesarean sections, lower limb surgeries, and urological or gynecological procedures.
- How to Prepare a Patient Planned for SAB
	- Preoperative Assessment
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Take a detailed medical history
		  *Allergies, Bleeding Disorders, Neurological Conditions, or previous spinal surgeries*
		- Perform a physical examination, focusing on the spine
		  *Scoliosis, Infection, Deformities*
		- Check for contraindications
		  *Coagulopathy, Sepsis or Increased Intracranial Pressure*
		- Obtain informed consent after explaining the procedure, risks and benefits
	- Investigations
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Baseline vitals
		  *Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation*
		- Relevant Lab Tests
		  *Hemoglobin, Coagulation Profile, Platelet Count, HbA1c, RBS*
	- Preoperative Fasting
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Ensure the patient is fasted
		  *6 hours for solids
		  2 hours for clear fluids*
	- Premedication
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Administer anxiolytics if needed
		  *Midazolam*
		- Ensure IV access is established for fluid administration and emergency medications
	- Positioning
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Position the patient in the lateral decubitus or sitting position with the back flexed to open the intervertebral spaces
	- Monitoring
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Attach standard monitors
		  *ECG, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure*
	- Aseptic Technique
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Clean the skin with an antiseptic solution and use sterile drapes
		  *Chorhexidine*
	- Procedure
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Identify the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace
		- Administer the local anesthetic into the subarachnoid space
		  *Hyperbaric Bupivacaine*
- # Complications
	- Hypotension
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Pathophysiology
			- Sympathetic blockade
			- vasodilation
			- decreased venous return
		- Management
			- Administer IV fluids
			  *preload with crystalloids*
			- Use vasopressors to maintain blood pressure
			  *phenylephrine or ephedrine*
			- Elevate the legs to improve venous return
	- Post-Dural Puncture Headache(PDHH)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Pathyphysiology
			- Leakage of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) through the dural puncture site
			- Decrease Intracranial Pressure
		- Management
			- Encourage oral hydration and caffeine
			- Administer analgesics
			  *paracetamol or NSAIDS*
			- Epidural Blood Patch if symptoms persist for >24-48 hours
	- Bradycardia or Cardiac Arrest
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Pathophysiology
			- High Spinal Block leading to unopposed vagal tone or severe hypotension
		- Management
			- Administer atropine for bradycardia
			- Start CPR and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols if cardiac arrest occurs
			- Ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation
