- 1 (*Her*)
	- Moments passed, aghast for your sound
	  I think I know
	- Now echoes strangely, without a word
	  the dawn skies glow
	- Her voice of which I can't hold
	  A fragment of imagination never untold
	-
	- I can't right now see her nor can
	  I hear
	- A wishper in the win, a comfort
	  ever dear
	- I hope one day I meet whom
	  these words belong
	- To hear them from her, so sweet
	  as a song
- 2 (*Me*)
	- I have known myself
	  all these years
	- But suddenly, I find myself lost
	  in midst of joy in tears
	- I fear, how could I search
	  I look everywhere, in the mirror i don't
	- But even in the mirror, that's not me
	  someone else's daunt
	- These complexities I didn't have
	  why am I so low
	- I was my friend
	  Now, how can I be the foe
	-
	- I want to find myself
	  tell me where to look
	- Tell me where my story is
	  show me my book
	- Folks know me, they still do
	  I am going to ask them who I am
	- For they might know
- 3 (*Us*)
	- The space between us, even if I travel fast
	  it seems it is will take some time
	- you seem to be 2 light years far away
	  I want to see u now, I want to hear you now
	- There is so much I want
	  the passing of time i can't disdain
	- Our fates have apparently aligned in the future
	  a state even relativity cannot explain
	- I am waiting, I hope I find
	  I hope I spend time in laughter
	- with you, my body and mind
	  In this world and the hereafter
