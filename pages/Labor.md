	  note:: `although this correlates with the cervical dilation, it is not the same, as that is the gap in between the cervix, while this is the thickness of the cervix itself`

	- Cervical Dilation
		- Latent phase : 0-5 cm
		- Active phase : ≥6 cm
	- Descent of Fetal Head (Station)
		- Measured from -5 (floating) to +5 (crowning)
	- Uterine Contractions
		- Frequency : Every 2-3 minutes in active labor
		- Duration : 45-60 seconds
		- Intensity : Moderate to strong (palpable or via tochography)
	- Additional Assessments
		- Maternal : Vital signs, pain, hydration, emotional state
		- Fetal : Heart rate monitoring (normal baseline : 110-160 bpm), variability, and absence of decelerations
