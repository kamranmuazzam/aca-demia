	- ## Position
	  definition:: Position of the presenting part relative to the maternal pelvis
	  usually:: the presenting part is as in the ((6711e29a-4322-4824-9315-2c675fe822cc))
		- at the back of the head is the [[posterior frontanallae]] which is trangular in shape(three sided), felt on palpation
		- Presenting part may be ((6711e53f-ec1b-4d7c-a5dc-68d2e7f65819)), ((6711e54d-19bb-4874-b660-9208a082a7a7)), ((6711e556-230e-4039-8556-33ca6989604a))

			- Occiput Position
			  alias:: Cephalic Position

			- Sacrum Position
			  id:: 6711e556-230e-4039-8556-33ca6989604a
			  alias:: Breech Position
		- Convention is (Side) + (Presenting Part) + (ant/post/trans)
			- ### Occiput anterior
			  alias:: OA
			  definition:: The occiput is directed anterior
			- ### Left Occiput anterior
			  alias:: LOA
			  definition:: The occiput is directed anteriorly, but slanted towards the maternal left
			- ### Right Occiput anterior
			  alias:: ROA
			  definition:: The occiput is directed anteriorly, but slanted towards maternal right
	- ## Attitude
	  definition:: Degree of flexion/extension of the fetal head
		- ### Vertical attitude
		  definition:: Maximal flexion(ideal)
		- ### Military attitude
		  definition:: Some flexion
		- ### Brow attitude
		  definition:: Some extension
		- ### Facial attitude
		  definition:: Maximal extension
	- ## Station
	  definition:: Descent of fetal presenting part relative to the maternal ischial spine, expressed in cm above(minus) or below(plus)
		- -3 means Fetal head is 3 cm superior the ischial spine
		- +3 means Fetal head is 3 cm inferior the ischial spine
- # Maternal Changes
	- ## Cervical dilation
	  definition:: opening/diameter of cervix during labor
		- Full Dilation of Cervix
		  id:: 6711ec53-8dd0-47dc-811d-012d2c2ec744
		  definition:: 10 cm cervical dilation
	- ## Cervical effacement
	  definition:: Thickness of the cervix, expressed as a percentage
	  note:: `although this correlates with the cervical dilation, it is not the same, as that is the gap in between the cervix, while this is the thickness of the cervix itself`
		- 2 cm is 0% effacement; 1 cm is 50%
		- 100% effacement
		  id:: 6711eafd-a950-4149-8d0b-d4c8828ef836
			- the cervix is simply a thin membrane
		- Effacement coincides with increasing levels of prostaglandins and oxytocin
			- Cervical ripening agents
				- [[Misoprostol]]
				- [[Laminaria]]
- # Stages of Labor
	- ## Stage One of Labor
	  definition:: Closed to ((6711ec53-8dd0-47dc-811d-012d2c2ec744))

		- ### Latent Stage One of Labor
		  definition:: Closed to 3-4 cm dilated
		- ### Active Stage One of Labor
		  definition:: 3-4 cm to full dilation (dilation accelerates)
			- Cardinal movements begin to occur
	- ## Stage Two of Labor
	  definition:: Full dilation to delivery of fetus
	- ## Stage Three of Labor
	  definition:: Delivery of fetus to delivery of placenta
	- ## Stage Four of Labor
	  definition:: The two hours following delivery
