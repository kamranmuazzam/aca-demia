- Progressive Optic Neuropathy meaning [[Peripheral Vision Loss]] followed by central vision loss
  id:: 670679fd-0957-4e98-9774-c0ab0ad988ff
- There is common misconception that glaucoma means increased [[IOP]] but there are glaucoma with normal [[IOP]] which are called [[Normal Tension Glaucoma]]
- 2nd most common cause of blindness in the world
- Triad of Glaucoma
	- Increased [[IOP]] > 22 mm Hg
	- Visual field defect
	- Optic Disc Changes

		- Types
		  collapsed:: true
			- Primary
				- cause unclear
				- more common
				- Congenital
					- birth to 3 months of life
					- this is due to birth defect in development of angle of eyes
						- [[Aqueous Humor]] cannot flow out normally, causing raise in [[IOP]] and then Glaucoma
					- Types
						- [[Primary Congenital Glaucoma]]
						- [[Developmental Glaucoma]]
							- associataed with aniridia(rare condition  characterized by abnormal development of the iris of the eye)
							- ectopic lentis syndrome
								- it is also inhertied connective tissue disorder that shares some features of Marfan syndrome
									- lens dislocation of eye
								- phacomatosis
							- Pathogenesis
								- Failure/ Abdnormal development of the [[Trabecular Meshwork of Eyeball]]
							- Clinical Features
								- Photophobia (Initial sign)
								- Blepharospasm (eye twitching)
								- lacrimation
								- eye rubbing
								- Corneal Signs
									- Oedema
									- enlargement
									- Haabs strie : tear and break in [[Descement's Membrane]]
								- Sclera : thin & blue
								- Anterior chamber : deep
								- Iris : atrophic patches in late stage
								- Optic disc : cupping and atrophy
								- IOP : raised
							- Treatment
								- medical : measure to control [[IOP]] and clear cloudy cornea prior to surgery
									- beta-adrenergic antagonists, CAI's
								- surgiacal
									- Goniotomy : for clear corneas
									- Trabeculotomy : for hazy corneas
				- Infantile
					- 3 months to 3 years
				- Juvenile
					- 3 years of age to 45 years
				- Adult
					- .>45 years
					- [[Open Angle Glaucoma]]
					- [[Chronic Angle Closure Glaucoma]]
					- these two are differentiated by [[Gonioscope]]
			- Secondary Open Angle Glaucoma
				- Uveitis
				- Neurovascular Diseases
				- Lense induced
				- Trauma
				- Steriods
				- Pigmentary
				- Retinopathy

- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Very high [[IOP]] need to be lowered immediately with the use of intravenous acetazolamide or mannitol
		- Oral acetazolamide or glycerol takes about 0.5-1 hour to control moderately high [[IOP]]
		- 1st Line of Treatment
			- [[ÃŸ-Blockers]], [[alpha-2 agonists]]
