- # Micro-Anatomy
  collapsed:: true
	- Pancreas doesn't have a fibrous capsule but has a fibrous covering which enters the pancreas as septa dividing it into lobules.
	- Each lobule contains alveolus/acinus which are glandular epithelium comprising of cuboidal cells
	- Each alveoli drain into intercalary duct  and many of which then combinedly drain into intralobular duct
	- ## Pancreatic Duct
		- ### Main Pancreatic Duct
		  alias:: Duct of Wirsung
			- Many Intralobular duct unify to form Interlobular duct which then unify to form the main pancreatic duct
			- This resembles the shape of a Herringbone(fish bone) pattern
			- This drains into major duodenal papilla through Ampulla of Vater as united with common bile duct
			- Sometimes the main pancreatic duct and common bile duct open separately at or near the major duodenal papilla (10-15%)
		- ### Accessory Pancreatic Duct
		  alias:: Duct of Santorini
			- The accessory pancreatic duct arise by the unification of Interlobular ducts of the Uncinate process
			- This has communication with the main pancreatic duct and drains into the 2nd part of duodenum through minor duodenal papilla
		- ## Islets of Langerhans
		  id:: 68a9e1ec-d7fd-4d39-b3fd-45c88316f2fd
			- Cluster of cells throughout the pancreas which are numerous in tail
			- There are four types of cell, alpha, beta, delta and polypeptide cells, beta cells are most predominant;68%
			- |Cell|Hormone|Stain|Function|
			  |--|--|--|--|
			  |Alpha|Glucagon|Red|- Increase Blood Glucose|
			  |Beta|Insulin|Blue|- Decrease Blood Glucose|
			  |Delta|Somatostatin||- Inhibit the above two|
			  |Popypeptide Cells| Polypeptide Hormones||- Stimulates the gastric and intestinal enzymes <br /> - inhibits gut motility|
- # Neurovasculature

	- Though developed from foregut it shows mixed supply
	- ## Artery Supply
		- Head and Neck is supplied by superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery
		- Body and Tail is supplied by branches of splenic artery of which the largest branch is  arteria pancreatica magna
	- >The venous drainage corresponds with the artery supply
	- ## Lymphatics
		- The head and neck of the pancreas is drains into pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes
		- The body and tail drain into pancreaticosplenic lymph nodes
	- ## Innervation
		- ### Sympathetic
			- Celiac & Superior mesenteric plexus
		- ### Parasympathetic
			- Vagus nerve
- # Developmental Anatomy
  collapsed:: true
	- The lining epithelium of the pancreas develops from the endoderm of the foregut. The organ itself forms from two distinct structures: a ventral and a dorsal pancreatic bud.
	- ## The Ventral Bud
		- Arises in conjunction with the bile duct.
		- Originally consists of two portions:
		      *   A left portion that later atrophies.
		      *   A right portion that persists.
		- Due to the rotation of the stomach and duodenum, the ventral bud swings posteriorly.
		- It eventually fuses with the dorsal bud.
		- Forms the **uncinate process** and the **inferior part of the head** of the pancreas.
	- ## The Dorsal Bud
		- Is the larger of the two buds.
		- It grows rapidly into the dorsal mesentery.
		- After fusion, it forms the **upper part of the head**, the **neck**, the **body**, and the **tail** of the pancreas.
	- >Initially, both pancreatic buds are intraperitoneal.
	  After fusion and the gut's rotation, the pancreas becomes secondarily retroperitoneal.
	- The lining epithelium of the pancreas develop from the foregut part of endoderm
	- The panceas actually has ventral and dorsal components.
	- The smaller Ventral bud arises in conjuction with the bile duct and consists of two portions
		- Left bud which atrophies during development
		- Right bud which swings posteriorly and unites with the inferior division of the dorsal bud
	- The Ventral Pancreatic bud swings posteriorly and unites with the ventral pancreatic bud
		- This is due to the rotation of duodenum with stomach
	- The ventral pancreatic bud forms the uncinate process and inferior part of head of pancreas
	- The dorsal pancreatic bud forms the upper part of the head, neck, body and tail of the pancreas
	- The pancretic buds are intraperitoneal and the pancreas is secondarily retroperitoneal
	- ## Clinical Correlation
		- Annular Pancreas
			- Failure of Obliteration of the left bud of the ventral pancreatic bud of which right and left fuse around the duodenum
			- This may cause duodenal obstruction
		-
- # Clinical Anatomy
  collapsed:: true
	- The most common type of pancreatic cancer is Carcinoma Head of Pancreas, and as common bile duct lies behind the posterior surface of head of pancreas, growth of head obstruct biliary flow causing Obstructive Jaundice
	- Gall stones if enter the main pancreatic duct causing pancreatitis which appear as "Transverse lie of stone" in X-Ray
	- As Pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ, bleeding here is seen as echymosis in the flanks(Grey Turner's Sign) and around the umbilicus(Cullen's Sign)
		- For blood to travel to the Flanks through the pararenal space
		- For blood to travel to the umbilicus, it first seeps through the Transversalis Fascia then to the umbilicus as fascia Scarpa is loosely adherent around the umbilicus
	- The pancreas develops from two buds, a dorsal and a ventral bud, which rotate and fuse; if this process is disrupted, it can lead to an Annular Pancreas where a ring of pancreatic tissue surrounds the duodenum, potentially causing obstruction.
	- The tail of the pancreas is closely related to the splenic hilum within the lienorenal ligament, which is why trauma to the spleen or surgery on the spleen can easily injure the pancreatic tail.
	- Pancreatic pain is often described as a boring pain that radiates to the back because the organ is retroperitoneal and its inflammation irritates the posterior parietal peritoneum and the rich celiac nerve plexus.
	- The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and superior mesenteric vein (SMV) run behind the neck of the pancreas and in front of the uncinate process; this is a critical relationship as tumors here often encase these vessels, making surgical resection very difficult.
	- The main pancreatic duct (Duct of Wirsung) usually joins the common bile duct to form the hepatopancreatic ampulla (Ampulla of Vater), which creates a shared channel; a gallstone impacted here can cause bile to reflux into the pancreatic duct, triggering acute pancreatitis.
	- Some people have a common anatomical variant called Pancreas Divisum where the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts fail to fuse(10-15%); this means most pancreatic drainage must go through the smaller accessory duct (Duct of Santorini), which can be insufficient and lead to recurrent pancreatitis.
	- The portal vein is formed behind the neck of the pancreas by the union of the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein; due to this proximity, pancreatic cancer can easily invade the portal vein, complicating surgery.
	- Because the pancreas drains its secretions into the duodenum, a severe injury to the pancreas or its ducts can lead to the leakage of corrosive pancreatic enzymes, which digest the surrounding tissues and cause autodigestion, inflammation, saponification, and pseudocyst formation.

	- ## The Exocrine Pancreas
	  collapsed:: true
		- The exocrine secretions together known as Pancreatic Juice include the following
			- Bicarbonate
			- Pancreatic Amylase
			- Pancreatic Lipase
			- Trypsinogen
			- Chymotrypsinogen
			- Nuclease
		- ### Bicarbonate
			- Along with the bile which is alkaline, the pancreatic bicarbonate neutralizes the acidic contents of stomach when it enters the duodenum.
			- This protects the duodenum and other parts of gut from a very low pH
			- This rising of pH is also important for the activity of other enzymes
		- ### Pancreatic Amylase
			- This causes breakage of the alpha glycosidic bond in the starch
			- $$\ce{Starch ->[Pancreatic Salivary Amylase] Maltose, Maltotriose, \alpha-limit dextrin}$$
		- ### Pancreatic Lipase
			- This causes breakdown of lipids
		- ### Trypsinogen
			- Activation of Trypsinogen
				- Trypsinogen gets activated by Enterokinase from the intestinal secretions
				- $$\ce{Trypsinogen ->[Enterokinase] Trypsin}$$
				- The remaining Trypsinogen activates by Trypsin itself
				- $$\ce{Trypsinogen ->[Trypsin] Trypsin}$$
			- Pancreatic Secretory Trypsin Inhibitor
			  alias:: PSTI, Serine Ppeptidase Inhibitor Kazal Type 1, SPINK1, Tumor Associated Trypsin Inhibitor, TATI
				- Trypsinogen doesn't get activated within the Pancreas because of the presence of PSTI
			- Trypsin activates the following series of enzymes
				- $$\ce{Chymotrypsinogen ->[Trypsin] Chymostrypsin}$$
				- $$\ce{Procarboxypeptidase ->[Trypsin] Carboxypeptidase}$$
				- $$\ce{Proelastase ->[Trypsin] Elastase}$$
				- $$\ce{Procollagenase ->[Trypsin] Collagenase}$$
				- $$\ce{Pronuclease->[Trypsin] Nuclease}$$
			- Trypsin and Chymotrypsin together digests Protein
				- $$\ce{Protein->[Trypsin, Chymotrypsin] Polypeptide}$$
		- Trypsinogen needs to undergo activation before it causes any damage, it undergoes activation by the help of enterokinase, the presence of enterokinase in larger concentrations is in the intestines, but enterokinase is not exclusive to intestines. Enterokinase is also present in the peritoneum and it's peritoneal fluid. That is why leakage of pancreatic juices into the peritoneal cavity is disastrous as Trypsinogen activates into Trypsin, remaining Trypsin activates following a cascade.

	- ## Pain Management
		- ### Opioid Analgesics
			- [[Morphine]] is traditionally thought to cause spasms of the Sphincter of Oddi, this is not relevant clinically, but the perception persists.
			  *In fact all opiods cause some spasm; this is not significant clinically, but still thought so*
			- [[Pethedine]] was historically preferred over morphine due to the misconception that it relaxed the Spincter of Oddi, but it has short duration of action and side effects such as neurotoxicity with prolonged use
			- [[Tramadol]] is the first-line choice for moderate pain
			- For severe pain, [[Fentanyl]] & [[Hydromorphone]] is used, [[Morphine]] can also be used
		- ### Non-Opioid Analgesics
			- [[Paracetamol]] ± [[NSAIDS]] are used for mild to moderate pain to reduce opioid requirements
			- Gabapentinoids; [[Gabapentin]], [[Pregabalin]] are first-line for chronic neuropathic pain componets often present in chronic pancreatitis
			- [[TCA]] ([[Amitriptyline]]//[[Nortriptyline]]) or an [[SNRI]] [[Duloxetine]] for chronic pain management
			- [[SSRIs]] are less effective for analgesia
	- ## Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy
	  alias:: PERT
	  id:: 68ab1160-cfe6-4a22-b18e-f539d5dd4b47
		- Amylase, Lipase and Proteases are found in enterically coated tablets/pills
		- This is used with patients having Pancreatic Enzyme insufficiency/Exocrine Pancreas Insufficiency(EPI) due to any cause; [[Chronic Pancreatitis]], [[Carcinoma Head of Pancreas]], post [[Pancreatectomy]]
		- The goal is to reduce [[Steatorrhea]], promote weight gain, and improve nutritional status. Adequate dosing also helps reduce abdominal cramping and bloating
		- This also has indirect antiemetic property as it decreases the gastric emptying time
	- ## Anti-Secretory Agents
		- Goal : To "put the pancreas to rest" by reducing its secretory activity
		- [[PPIs]], e,g: [[Omeprazole]] : While evidence for directly improving outcomes is limited, they are widely used to prevent stress-related GI ulcers in hospitalzed patients and may reduce acid-medited stimulation of pancreatic secretion
		- Somatostatin Analogs: e.g: [[Octreotide]] , this inhibits the release of gastrin, CCK, secretin and other hormones that stimulate pancreatic secretion. Its use is specialized and not routine, typically considered in severe, refractory cases or pancreatic fistulas
	- ## Management of Pancreatogenic Diabetes, aka, Type-IIIc Diabetes
		- Diabetes Mellitus is common complication of chronic pancreatitis due to the destruction of islet cells
		- **Insulin Therapy**: Often required. The loss of glucagon-secreting alpha cells increases the risk of hypoglycemia, so regimens must be carefully managed
		- Caution with Oral Hypoglycemics: Sulfonylureas are generally avoided due to high risk of hypoglycemia. [[Metformin]] is first-line if insulin production is still present.
	- ## Nutritional Support
		- Fat Soluble Vitamins: (A, D, E, K) Supplementation is mandatory in patients with Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency(EPI) to prevent deficiencies (e.g., night blindness, osteoporosis, coagulopathy). The absorption of the fat soluble vitamins still require ((68ab1160-cfe6-4a22-b18e-f539d5dd4b47)) though
		- Medium-Chain Triglyceride (MCT) Oil: A unique fat that is absorbed directly into the portal bloodstream without requiring pancreatic lipase digestion. It is a useful caloric supplementation for patients with severe EPI
		- In severe cases of Paralytic Ileus or Obstruction, Parenteral Nutrition is provided with IV Amino Acids & Dextrose
