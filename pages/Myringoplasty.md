- #definition Closure of perforation of pars tensa of the tympanic membrane is called myingoplasty
- # Types
	- ## Underlay technique
	- ## Overlay technique
- # Indication
	- Dry central perforation without mastoid pathology
	- Intact ossicular chain and mild hearing loss
- # Contraindication
	- Active discharge from middle ear
	- Nasal allergy
	- Otitis externa
	- Ingrowth of squamous epithelium into middle ear
	- When the other ear is dead or not suitable for hearing aid rehabilitation
	- Children below 3 years
- # Anesthesia
	- Local or general, the former is preferred
- # Position
	- Supine with face turned to one side; the ear to be operated is up
- Graft materials used are
	- Temporalis fascia (most common)

	- Perichondrium from the tragus

- # Complications
	- ## Underlay Technique
		- Middle ear becomes narrow
		- Graft may get adherent to the promontory
		- Anteriorly, graft may lose contact from the remnant of tympanic membrane leading to anterior perforation
	- ## Overlay Technique
		- Blunting of the anterior sulcus
		- Epithelial pearls. They are epidermal cysts, when squamous epithelium is buried under the graft
		- Lateralization of graft. Graft loses contact from the malleus handle resulting in conductive loss.
		  *It is prevented by tucking the graft under the handle*
