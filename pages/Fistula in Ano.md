alias:: anal fistula
ICD-11_Code::
tags:: disease, general surgery

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Usually secondary to anorectal abscess (caused by polymicrobial infection, often mixed aerobic/anaerobic bacteria)
		- Less commonly : Tuberculosis, Chron's disease, trauma, malignancy, or radiation proctitis
	- ### Risk Factors
		- History of anorectal abscess (most common)
		- Chron's disease (upto 30% of patients with Crohn's develop fistulas)
		- Diabetes mellitus
		- Immunosuppression
		- Pelvic radiation
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- ~1-2 per 10k anually
	- ### Prevalence
		- ### Demographics
			- sex : Higher in males (2:1 male to female ration)
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- No specific geographic predilection; higher in populations with untreated abscesses or Crohn's disease
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Anorectal abscess -> rupture/spontaneous drainage -> persistent epithelialized tract (fistula) between anus/rectum and perianal skin
		- Cryptoglandular hypothesis : Infection in anal galnds (at dentate line) spreads to intersphincteric space
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Anorectal region (internal sphincter, external sphincter, perianal skin)
		- Complex fistulas may invovle pelvic organs (e.g., vagina in rectovaginal fistula)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Persistent perianal discharge (pus/blood)
			- Pain (if abscess reaccumulates)
			- Pruritius ani
		- #### Signs
			- Fistula opening and Scarring
			- DRE
				- Induration
				- Tenderness
				- Palpable Tracts
			- Proctoscopy : May identify internal opening at dentate line
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Parks Classification (based on tract relation to sphincters)
			- Intersphincteric (most common, 70%)
			- Transsphincteric
			- Suprasphincteric
			- Extrasphincteric
		- Simple vs. Complex
			- Simple : Low fistula (below dentate line), single tract
			- Complex : High fistula, multiple tracts, recurrent, or associated with Crohn's
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical History + Physical Exam (External opening, palpable tract)
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Examination under anesthesia
			  *If diagnosis is unclear*
				- Performed to directly visualize and probe the fistula tract
			- MRI pelvis (gold standard for complex fistulas)
			- Endoanal ultrasound (with hydrogen peroxide enhancement)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |Pilonidal sinus|Midline location, no internal opening|
			  |Hidradenitis suppuratia| Multiple sinuses, no rectal connection|
			  |Rectal malignancy| Biospy, imaging|
		- ### General Assessment
			- Rule out Crohn's, Malignancy (colposcopy if suspected)
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Simple Fistula
			- Fistulotomy
			  *success rate > 90%*
				- Suitable for low fistulas (below the sphincter complex)
				- The fistula tract is laid open, allowing it to ((67bf1fb6-98ec-4c01-876a-9651500aec04))
			- Fistulectomy
		- Complex Fistula
			- Partial Fistulotomy with Seton Placement
				- A non-absorbable suture (seton) is placed through the fistula tract to allow drainage and promote healing
				- Can be used a cutting seton (gradually tightened to cut through the tract) or a draining seton (left loose to control infection)
			- Rectal Advancement Flap
				- A mucosal or full-thickness flap is used to cover the internal opening, often used for high or complex fistulas.
			- [[Ligation of Intersphicteric Fistula Tract]] Procedure
			- Fibrin Glue or Collagen Plug
				- Less invasive options, but with lower success rates. Suitable for select cases.
			- [[Fistula-tract Laser Closure]]
	- ### Management of Underlying Conditions
		- Chron's Disease or other systemic conditions
		- Immunosuppressants
	- ### Antibiotics
		- Used if there is active infection or cellulitis, but not as a definitive treatment
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- High-Fiber Diet
		- Perianal Hygiene
		- Sitz bath
	- ### Follow-up
		- Detect Recurrence (10-30% risk)
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- 60-90% cure rate (depends on complexity)
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Recurrent abscess
				- Fecal incontinence (if sphincter damaged)
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Chronic Discharge
				- Malnutrition (Chron's)
