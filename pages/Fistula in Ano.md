	- ### Surgical Options
		- Fistulotomy
			- Suitable for low fistulas (below the sphincter complex)
			- The fistula tract is laid open, allowing it to ((67bf1fb6-98ec-4c01-876a-9651500aec04))
		- Seton Placement
			- A non-absorbable suture (seton) is placed through the fistula tract to allow drainage and promote healing
			- Can be used a cutting seton (gradually tightened to cut through the tract) or a draining seton (left loose to control infection)
		- Advancement Flap
			- A mucosal or full-thickness flap is used to cover the internal opening, often used for high or complex fistulas.
		- [[Ligation of Intersphicteric Fistula Tract]] Procedure
		- Fibrin Glue or Collagen Plug
			- Less invasive options, but with lower success rates. Suitable for select cases.
		- [[Fistula-tract Laser Closure]]
	- ### Management of Underlying Conditions
		- Chron's Disease or other systemic conditions
		- Immunosuppressants
	- ### Antibiotics
		- Used if there is active infection or cellulitis, but not as a definitive treatment
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Perianal Hygiene
	- ### Follow-up
