# Classification
	- Hemorrhagic Causes
	- Non-Hemorrhagic Causes
		- Sever Dehydration
			- Vomiting
			- Diarrhea
			- Burns
		- Fluid loss from third-spacing
- # Presentation
	- Symptoms
		- History
			- Trauma/ Burn
			- Vomiting/ Diarrhoea
		- Apparant Haemorrhage
	- Signs
		- Tachycardia
		- Hypotention
		- Weak Pulse
		- Cold Extremities
- # Metabolic Responses
	- ↑ Gluconeogenesis ↑ Glycogenolysis
	- Protein Catabolism and Lipolysis
	- Anaerobic Respiration
	- Lactic Acidosis
	- Decreased ATP production
- # Endocrine Responses
	- Activation of Sympathetic Nervous System
	  *[[Epinephrine]] & [[Norepinephrine]]*
		- Tachycardia -> ↑ Blood Flow
		- Vasoconstriction -> ↑ Blood Pressure
	- Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System Activation
		- Angiotensin II -> vasoconstriction
		- Aldosterone -> Sodium and Water Retention in Kidneys
	- Antidiuretic Hormone Release
		- Water Reabsorption
		- Vasoconstriction
	- Cortisol Release
	  *Activation of Hypothalamic Pituitary Adrenal Axis*
		- Increases gluconeogenesis and lipolysis for energy
		  *Glucose*
		- Suppresses inflammation and immune responses
	- Insulin Resistance
		- Catecholamines and Cortisol cause peripheral tissues to become resistant to insulin, ensuring glucose availability for vital organs like the brain and heart
	- Glucagon Release
		- Glucagon promotes glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
- # Management
	- Primary Survery (cABCDE) and Resuscitation
		- control of Catastrophic Haemorrhage
		- Circulation and IV Access : Establish two large-bore IV lines
			- Administer Isotonic Crystalloids
			- Blood Grouping, Cross Matching, Blood Transfusion
			- Hemorrhage Control
	- Adjuvant to Primary Survey and Resuscitation
		- Monitoring
			- Urinary Catheterization : Monitor Urine Output
			- ECG : Monitor for arrhythmias
			- Blood Pressure
			- Pulse Oximeter
		- Imaging
			- AP Chest X-Ray : Access for hemothorax or pneumothorax
			- AP Pelvis X-Ray : Assess for pelvic fractures (major bleeding source)
			- Ultrasound(FAST) : Detect intra-abdominal bleeding
	- Consider Need for Patient Transfer
	- Secondary Survery
		- Reevaluation of Vital Signs
		- Complete History and Physical Examination
		- Head to Toe Examination
		- Indicated X-Rays - To rule out fractures, further bleeding sources, and injury to organs
		- Repeat FAST if necessary
	- Definitive Treatment
		- Identify and Control Bleeding
		- Restore Circulating Volume
		- Prevent Secondary Complications
		  *Hypothermia, Acidosis, Coagulopathy*
