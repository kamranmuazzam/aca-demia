- # Ancient Egyptians
	- Opium poppy + Hyoscyamus
	  *Opiate + Hyoscyamine*
	- In modern time this has been replaced with Scopolamine + Hyoscyamine
	  *Premedication for Anesthesia*
- # The Incas
  13th-16th Century
  Modern South America around the Equator
	- Chew some Coca plants and spit the extracts to elevate the pain of surgery
	- [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] noticed that the Native people dipped their arrows in some green liquid which would paralyze their prey
		- A donkey could survive the poison if artificial ventilation was provided
		  *It means that the poison causes Respiratory Paralysis(Diaphragmatic Paralysis)*
		- So, this poison was a Neuromuscular Blocker
		- This green poison was [[Curare]]
		  *Hence the [[Curarine]]*
- # Britain
	- [[Joseph Priestley]] discovered that Nitrous Oxide is an anesthetic
	  1722, an English chemist
		- $$\ce{NO->[Fe + Hg] N2O}$$
		- He called it *Dephlogisticated* Nitrous Air
			- aids in combustion
			- Due to this combustive nature it can cause **Airway Fires**
			- Tho [[Joseph Priestley]] didn't came to know about it's Anesthetic use
	- [[Humphry Davy]]
		- He used to add nitrous oxide gas in airtight room feeling exhilaration & euphoria
		- This was used as a laughing gas and recognized as such
	- [[James Y Simpson]] & [[John Snow]]
	  1847
	  *[[Edinburg]], [[Scottland]]*
		- Used Inhaled Chloroform on Queen Victoria
		-
- # USA
  Hartford, Connecticut
	- Two Englishmen [[Horace Wells]] and [[Samuel Cooley]] having a party, they were inhaling *Nitrous Oxide* for fun
	- [[Samuel Cooley]] bumbed his foot into a chair and had lacerations, [[Horace Wells]] inquired about the pain to which they realized that there was no pain / no feeling
	- [[Horace Wells]] applied this on next day for Tooth Extraction on another patient and reported no pain
- 1846
	- Diethyl Ether(Ether)
		- Excision of a neck mass
- 1856
	- Cocaine extracted from *Erythroxylon coca*
- 1858
	- The invention of [[Hypodermic needle]] in 1855 allowed development of Hypodermal injection of morphone
		- This was used as treatment of Painful neuralgia
- 1905
	- Discovery of Procaine, which is less toxic than Procaine
- In the 20th Century
	- Intubation & Mechanical Ventilation
	- Laryngeal Mask Airway
- 1930s
	- [[Ruth Gill]] & [[Richard Gill]] brought 25 pounds [[Curare]] from Interior Junge
	  *During the Great Depression*
		- After [[Curare]] There was Muscle Relaxation and Bronchodilation along with Inhaled Anesthetics
	- [[Cyclopropane]] used as alternative of Chloroform and Ether
		- Due to Low [[Blood Gas Partition Coefficient]]
			- Rapid Onset
			- Smooth Induction
			- Fast Recovery
		- Muscle Relaxation and Analgesia
		- It was still dangerous because of it's flammable/explosive nature
- 1956
	- Halothane was introduced which replaced [[Cyclopropane]]
		- *Due to its non-flammable nature, making it significantly safer to used in the operating room and also doesn't cause Respiratory Depression as of Chloroform*

- # Surgical Operations before Anesthetics
  Without any anesthetic intervention until $$\ce{N2O}$$ (1844) ether (1846) and chloroform (1847)
	- Before 1846, People had been using variable non reliable methods and the following was used in severe cases
		- ## Blunt Force Trauma on Head
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ## Strangulation or Carotid Compression
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- ## Physical Restraint
