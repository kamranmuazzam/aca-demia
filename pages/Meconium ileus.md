alias:: Neonatal intestinal obstruction due to inspissated meconium
ICD-11_Code::
tags:: disease

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Thick, viscous meconium due to abnormal intestinal secretions (often linked to cystic fibrosis [CF])
		- Pancreatic insufficiency (lack of digestive enzymes)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Cystic fibrosis (most common cause)
		- Familial history of CF
		- Low birth weight or prematurity
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- ~10-20% of newborns with cystic fibrosis present with meconium ileus
		- Occurs in 1 in 2k-3k live births
	- ### Prevalence
		- Higher in populations with high CF carrier rates (Caucasians)
		- ### Demographics
			- More common in Caucasians (CF-related)
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Higher in regions with European ancestry
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Abnormally thick meconium obstructs the terminal ileus
		- Due to defective CFTR protein -> dehydration of intestinal secretions -> inspissated meconium
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Gastrointestinal (small intestine, colon)
		- Pancreas (if CF-related)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Failure to pass meconium within 24-48 hours
			  *minimal meconium might be present*
			- Abdominal distension
			- Bilious vomiting
		- #### Signs
			- Palpable doughy mass in the right lower quadrant
			- Scaphoid abdomen (if proximal obstruction)
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Simple meconium ileus (no complications)
		- Complicated meconium ileus (volvulus, perforation, necrosis)
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical Findings + Imaging (X-ray, contrast enema)
		- Sweat chloride test (if CF suspected)
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Abdominal X-ray
				- Dilated loops of small bowel
				- soap bubble sign (air mixed with meconium)
				  *Neuhauser's Sign, Honey Comb Sign, Mottling*
			- Contrast enema
				- Microcolon with obstruction at terminal ileum
			- Sweat chloride test
			- Genetic Testing (CFTR mutations)
			- vomitus testing -> absence of trypsin (cannot digest X-ray film gelatin)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |Hirschprung disease|No abdominal Mass,Rectal biopsy, absence of ganglion cells|
			  |Intestinal atresia| No meconium pass at all, Contrast study shows blind-ending bowel|
			  |Necrotizing enterocolitis| Prematurity, pneumatosis on X-ray|
		- ### General Assessment
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Gastrografin enema (osmotic agent to loosen meconium)
		- N-acetylcysteine (mucolytic agent)
		- IV fluids & electrolyte correction
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Enterotomy & Irrigation (if enema fails)
		- Resection + Stoma (complicated cases)
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Pancreatic enzyme replacement (if CF-related)
		- High calorie diet
	- ### Follow-up
		- Monitor for CF-related complications
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Good survival (>90%) if uncomplicated
			- Short bowel syndrome(if resection needed)
			- Recurrent bowel obstruction
		- #### Without Treatment
			- Intestinal perforation, sepsis, death
	- ### Survival Rates
		- #### With Treatment
			- .>90% with early intervention
		- #### Without Treatment
			- Poor if untreated (sepsis, necrosis)
	- ### Quality of Life Considerations
- ## Prevention
