- ## Composition
	- Desquamated Epithelium
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Dirt
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Secretion of (Formation) #ent-prof-card
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number

		- Sebaceous gland
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Ceriminous gland
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Excretion of Wax
	- By movement of jaw during eating, talking, chewing, etc
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Expelled in flakes but in certain individuals & children the wax accumulates -> external canal obstruction
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Consistency
	- Soft -> if secretion increased
	- Hard -> if secretion decreased
- ## Function of normal wax
	- Lubrication
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Antibacterial (Bacteriostatic & Fungistatic -> due to acidic pH)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Protection of ear from insect (foreign material) & dust
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number

  background-color:: blue
  id:: 6733ccef-7988-48c3-99dc-0de47e748645
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Long standing impacted wax may ulcerate the meatal skin & result in granuloma formation (_wax granuloma_)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Excessive formation (hyper-secretion of gland)
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Excessive desquamation of canal wall
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Narrowing of external auditory canal
		- Hairy external ear
		- Frequent use of cotton bud - it hampers the normal cleaning
		- Hot Humid climate

		- #### Signs
	- ### Auroscopic Examination

	- ### Medical Treatment : no medical treatment
	  background-color:: red
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Removal by [[Syringing the Ear]] or Instrumental manipulation
			- Hard imapced mass may sometimes require prior softening with wax solvents
				- 5% $$\ce{NaHCO3}$$ in equal parts of glycerine and water instilled two or three times a day for a few days
				- Hydrogen peroxide, liquid paraffin or olive oil may also achieve the same result
				- Commercial drops containing ceruminolytic agents like paradichlorobenzene 2% can also be used and above methods tried again
				  *glycerin as well*
		- Any ulceration seen in meatal wall as a result of impacted wax is protected by application of suitable antibiotic ointment
