# Procedure
	- The superior punctum and cnaliculus was dilated with a [[Nettleship Punctum Dilator]]
	- A small Lacrimal Probe(np. 1 or 0) was inserted vertically into the canaliculus, and then passed gently but firmly in horizontal direction until the point is felt against the lacrimal bone
	- The probe was then rotaed downwards and towards the midline, and pushed down the nasal duct until it touches the floor of the nose
	  remember:: that the duct is short in the newborn
	  Little force is required if applied correctly in the line of the duct
	- Syringing with saline stained with Betadine with suction catheter in node was done to look for patency during the procedure
	- A balloon dilation of the duct or placement of a silicone tube may be used as a secondary procedure
- Use of nasal endocospe for direct visualization of the terminal end of the obstructed nasolacrimal duct/probe and presence of inferior turbinate hypertrophy has improved the overall success of primary therapeutic probing in congenital cases
