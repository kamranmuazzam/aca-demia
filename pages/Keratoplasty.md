- #definition Keratoplasty (corneal transplantation) is a surgical procedure where damaged or diseased corneal tissue is replaced with healthy donor corneal tissue to restore vision, reduce pain, or improve corneal integrity.

- # Criteria of Donor
	- Age : 2-70 years (younger preferred)
	- No systemic infections (HIV, Hepatitis, B/C, syphilis, rabies, prion disese)
	- No ocular diseases (glaucoma, uveitits, corneal opacity, retinoblastoma)
	- Death to preservation time : <12 hours (warm ischemia) or <24 hours (if refrigerated)
- # Criteria of Recipient
	- No active ocular infection (e.g, keratitis, endophthalmitis)
	- Adequate tear film & lid function
	- No severe dry eye or uncontrolled glaucoma
	- Realistic visual potential (healthy retina & optic nerve)
- # Indication
	- Optical
		- Penetrating Keratoplasty
			- Corneal opacity (scar, dystrophy, degeneration)
			- Keratoconus (if contact lenses fail)
			- Pseudophakic Bullous Kerapathy
		- Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty
			- Opacification of anterior 1/3rd of stroma
			- Recurrent Pterygium
		- Posterior Lamellar Keraplasty
			- Fuch's Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy
	- Therapeutic
		- Non-healing corneal ulcers (bacterial, fungal, viral)
		- Corneal perforation
	- Tectonic
		- Corneal thinning (e.g., Terrien's marginal degeneration)
	- Cosmetic
		- Improvement appearance of a blind, disfigured eye
- # Overcoming Barriers. to Eye Donation in Bangladesh
	- ## Public Awareness
		- Community Campaigns
		- Religious Leader's involvement (Islam permits eye donation)
	- ## Hospital Based Donation Programs
		- Train staff to request donations in ICUs & trauma centers
	- ## Infrastructure improvement
		- Establish more eye banks with proper storage (M-K media)
	- ## Legal & Ethical Framework
		- Simplify consent process, ensure transparency
	- ## Myth Musting
		- Address misconceptions (e.g., "donation delays burial", "blindness in afterlife")
- # Contraindications
	- ## Absolute
		- HIV< Hepatitis B/C, syphilis, rabies, prion diseases
		- Leukemia, Lymphoma, active sepsis
		- Unknown cause of death
	- ## Relative
		- Previous Intraocular Surgery (cataract, LASIK - case-by-case evalulation)
		- History of Ocular Inflammation (uveitis, retinitis)
		- Corneal Diseases
			- Keratoconus (Posterior Lamellar Keratoplasty can be performed as Descent's membrane is only required as of Fuch's dystrophy)
- # Function of an Eye Bank
	- Donor Tissue Collection : Retrieval, screening, and preservation
	- Tissue Processing : Evaluation (slit-lamp, specular microscopy), cutting grafts (DSAEK/DMEK)
	- Storage & Distribution : Using McCarey-Kaufman (M-K) medium or organ culture
	- Quality Control : Checking endothelial cell count, sterility testing
	- Research & Training : Improving Transplantation techniques
	- Public Awareness : Promoting eye donation through campaigns
