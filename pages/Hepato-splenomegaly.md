- # Differentials
	- ## 1. Hematologic / Malignancy
		- Children (esp. toddlers, preschoolers, school-age)
			- [[Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia]] (peak: 2-5 years)
			- [[Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia]] (<4 years)
			- Lymphomas (usually older children/adolescents)
		- Adults
			- Chronic Leukemias ([[Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia]], [[Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia]])
			- [[Myeloproliferative Disorders]]
	- ## 2. Hemolytic Anemias
		- Children
			- [[Thalassemia major]] (presents in infancy/toddler age once HbF falls, typically <2-3 years)
			- Hereditary spherocytosis (any age, often diagnosed in childhood)
			- Sickle cell disease (manifests after infancy, around 6 months onward)
		- Adults
			- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (more common in adults)
	- ## 3. Infections
		- Children
			- Malaria (tropical/endemic areas, any age, preschool often severely affected)
			- VIsceral leishmaniasis (Kala-azar) (toddlers + school-age children in endemic areas)
			- EBV / CMV infectious mononucleosis (school-age + adolescents, but can occur earlier)
			- Congenital infections (TORCH), although usually evident <1 year
		- Adults
			- Chronic hepatitis B/C, HIV, EBV, malaria reinfections
	- ## 4. Storage / Inborn Errors of Metabolism
		- Children
			- Gaucher disease (most common lysosomal storage disease; typically presents 2-10 years)
			- Niemann-Pick Disease (type A: infancy; type B: later childhood, ~2-6 years)
			- Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) (variable onset; usually toddlers/preschoolers)
		- Adults: (rare to present primarily in adulthood, though Type 1 Gaucher can be adult-onset)
	- ## 5. Congestive/ Circulatory
		- Children
			- Congestive heart failure (any age, esp. congenital heart disease)
			- Portal hypertension from chronic liver disease (biliary atresia sequelae, cirrhosis in older children)
		- Adults
			- Cirrhosis (alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis)
			- Right-sided heart failure
	- ## 6. Others
		- Children
			- Langerhans cell histiocytosis
			- Immunodeficiency syndromes with recurrent infections (e.g., chronic granulomatous disease)
		- Adults
			- Amyloidosis
			- Lymphoproliferative disorders
- Top Differentials for 3 year old
	- Differentials
		- Leukemia (ALL/JMML)
		- Thalassemia major
		- Sickle Cell Anemia
		- Gaucher Disease
		- Malaria/Kala-azar
		- EBV/CMV
	- Investigations
		- Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Peripheral Smear
		- Reticulocyte count
		- Hemoglobin electrophoresis / HPLC
		- Bone marrow aspiration & biopsy
		- Malaria smear and Rapid diagnostic test (antigen)
		- rK39 test (Kala-azar serology)
		- EBV and CMV serology (IgM, IgG, PCR if indicated)
		- Liver Function Tests (LFTs)
		- LDH, uric acid
		- Enzyme assay for β-glucocerebrosidase (for Gaucher)
		- Genetic testing (if Gaucher / hemoglobinopathies suspected)
		- Abdominal Ultrasound
	- Expected Findings
		- **Leukemia (ALL/JMML):** CBC: anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis/penia, blasts on smear. Bone marrow >25% blasts (ALL). JMML: Monocytosis, abnormal myeloid precursors.
		- **Thalassemia major:** Severe anemia, microcytic hypochromic RBCs, high reticulocyte count, low MCV, Hb electrophoresis with ↑HbF/↑HbA2.
		- **Sickle cell disease:** Anemia, sickled cells, HbS on electrophoresis, vaso-occlusive history.
		- **Gaucher Disease:** Pancytopenia, splenomegaly out of proportion, Gaucher cells on marrow, enzyme assay with low β-glucocerebrosidase.
		- **Malaria/Kala azar:** Malarial parasite in smear or Antigen +; Kala azar with pancytopenia, amastigotes in marrow/spleen; positive rK39 serology.
		- **EBV/CMV infection:** Lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, positive IgM serology.
