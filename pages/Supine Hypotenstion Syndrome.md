- ## Cause
	- Compression of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus in the supine position.
- # Etiopathogenesis
	- ## Normal Response
		- Opening up of collateral circulation via:
			- [[Paravertebral veins]]
			- [[Azygos veins]]
	- **Failure of Collateral Circulation (10% of cases)**:
	- **Effect**: Reduced venous return to the heart.
- # Symptoms
	- Hypotension
	- Tachycardia
	- Syncope (fainting)
- # Management
	- **Intervention**: Turning the patient to a left lateral position.
	- **Effect**: Restores normal blood pressure by relieving compression on the vena cava.
- # Mechanism During Labor

	- **Result**: Prevents symptoms from manifesting during labor.
- # Prevention #18obGyn
	- Avoid Supine Position -> Left Lateral Position
