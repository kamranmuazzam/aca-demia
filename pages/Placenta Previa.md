definition:: When the placenta is implanted partially or completely over the lower uterine segment (over and adjacent to the internal os) it is called placenta previa #obs-prof-card

- # Types #obs-prof-card 
  based-on:: depending upon the degree of extension of placenta to the lower segment
	- Type-I
	  alias:: Low-lying
		- The major part of the placenta is attached to the upper segment and only the lower margin encroaches onto the lower segment not up to the os
	- Type-II
	  alias:: Marginal
		- The placenta reaches the margin of the internal os but does not cover it.
	- Type-III
	  alias:: Incomplete or partial central
		- The placenta covers the internal os partially (covers the internal os when closed but does not entirely do so when fully dilated)
	- Type-IV
	  alias:: Central or total
		- The placenta completely covers the internal os even after it is fully dilated
