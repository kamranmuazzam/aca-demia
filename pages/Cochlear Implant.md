- #definition A cochlear implant is an electronic medial device that provides sound perception to individuals with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss by directly stimulating the auditory nerve
- # Components
	- External Part
		- Microphone (picks up sound)
		- Speech processor (converts sound to digital signals)
		- Transmitter coil (sends signal to the internal implant)
	- Internal Part
	  *Surgically Implanted*
		- Receiver-stimulator (decodes signals)
		- Electrode array (stimulates the cochlear nerve fibers)
- # Indications
	- Severe-to-profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss
	- Limited benefit from hearing aids (<50% speech discrimination)
	- Post-lingual deafness (better outcomes)
	- Pre-lingual deafness (early implantation in children <2 years for best results)
- # Contraindications
	- Absence of cochlear nerve or cochlea (e.g., Michel aplasia)
	- Active middle ear infection
	- Unrealistic patient expectations
- # Surgical Procedure
	- Performed under general anesthesia
	- Mastoidectomy + facial recess approach to access cochlea
	- Electrode array inserted into scala tympani of cochlea
- # Complications
	- Facial Nerve Injury
	- Meningitis (risk reduced with vaccination)
	- Device failure or migration
	- Tinnitus or vertigo
