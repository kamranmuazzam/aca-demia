- Measurement of power of intraocular lens
- measures axial length of the eyeball
- normal axial length: 23-24 mm
- Normal power of human eyeball : + 60 D
	- Cornea: + 43 D

	- Lens: + 17 D
- # Components
	- A scan to measure axial length of the eyeball.
	- Keratometry to assess corneal diapteric power
- SRK formula to measure Keratometry
	- IOL = A - 2.5L - PK
	- >A= A constat
	  L = Axial length
	  K = Keratometric reading
	  P = Power
