alias:: Trisomy 21
ICD-11_Code:: LD40.0
tags:: #Disease #Genetic #Chromosomal

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) due to:
			- **Non-disjunction** (95% of cases)
			- **Robertsonian translocation** (4% of cases)
			- **Mosaicism** (1% of cases)
		- Since 50% of females with Down Syndrome are fertile and 50% of their progeny have risk of Down Syndrome, it can be inherited as well
	- ### Risk Factors
		- **Advanced maternal age** (primary risk factor)
		- **Previous child with Down syndrome**
		- **Parental translocation carrier**
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- 1 case in 800 live births
		- ~6000 children born with Down syndrome each year (USA)
	- ### Prevalence
		- ~250,000 individuals in the USA
		- ### Demographics
			- Accounts for ~1/3 of moderate-to-severe intellectual disabilities in school-aged children.
			- **Age-Related Demographics**:
				- 15-29 years - 1 case in 1500 live births
				- 30-34 years - 1 case in 800 live births
				- 35-39 years - 1 case in 270 live births
				- 40-44 years - 1 case in 100 live births
				- >45 years - 1 case in 50 live births
			- **Sex-Related Demographics**:
				- Male-to-female ratio in free trisomy 21: **1.15:1**
				- ~50% of females with trisomy 21 are fertile (50% risk of passing it to offspring).
				- Males are usually infertile (except in mosaicism).
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Occurs worldwide in all ethnic groups.
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Extra chromosome 21 → overexpression of genes (e.g., **DYRK1A**, **RCAN1**) → developmental and physiological abnormalities.
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- **Neurological**
			- Intellectual disability
			- Alzheimer-like pathology
				- By age 40, nearly all individuals with Down Syndrome develop **amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles**, the hallmarks of Alzheimer disease.
				- Reason:
				  → **APP gene** (amyloid precursor protein) is on **chromosome 21**
				  → Extra copy = increased amyloid-β accumulation
				- It is the most common cause of death in adults with Down's Syndrome
		- **Cardiac**: Congenital heart defects (e.g., AVSD, VSD).
			- It is the most common cause of death in children with Down's Syndrome
		- **Musculoskeletal**: Hypotonia, joint laxity.
		- **Endocrine**: Hypothyroidism, diabetes risk.
		- **Hematologic**
			- Leukemia predisposition. (ALL, AML-M7)
		- **Intestinal**
			- Duodenal atresia
			- Hirschprung disease
			- Imperforate anus(less common)
		- **Opthalmological**
			- Brushfield spots on iris (diagnostic sign)
			- Congenital cataracts
			- Strabismus
			- Nystagmus
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Developmental delay
			- Intellectual disability (IQ 25–70)
			- Speech/language delays
		- #### Signs
			- **Dysmorphic features**:
				- Flat facial profile, upslanting palpebral fissures (over-expression of **DSCAM**)
				- Epicanthal folds, Brushfield spots (iris)
				- Small ears, protruding tongue
				- Single palmar crease, sandal gap toes
			- Hypotonia
			- Short stature

	- ### Stages or Classification
		- **Free trisomy 21** (most common)
		- **Translocation Down syndrome**
		- **Mosaic Down syndrome**
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical features + **karyotyping** (confirmatory).
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- **Prenatal**:
				- Screening (NIPT, triple/quad screen, ultrasound).
				- Diagnostic (CVS, amniocentesis).
			- **Postnatal**: Karyotype (blood or tissue sample).
			- **Endocrine**: Hypergonadoropic hypogonadism (High FSH, LH and Low Estrogen)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- | DD | Ruling Out |
			  |---|---|
			  | **Zellweger syndrome** | Karyotype normal |
			  | **Congenital hypothyroidism** | Thyroid function tests |
			  | **Other trisomies (18, 13)** | Karyotype |
		- ### General Assessment
			- Echocardiogram (cardiac defects).
			- Hearing/vision screening.
			- Thyroid function tests.
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- **Early intervention programs** (speech, OT, PT).
		- **Cardiac surgery** (if congenital defects).
		- **Thyroid hormone replacement** (if hypothyroid).
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Repair of **AVSD**, **VSD**, or **duodenal atresia**.
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- **Physical activity** (for obesity prevention).
		- **Balanced diet** (high fiber, low calorie).
	- ### Follow-up
		- Annual thyroid screening.
			- Screen for congenital Hypothyroidism at birth
			- check for TSH and free T4 every 6 months during first 3 years of life, and anually thereafter
		- Regular cardiac/audiologic/ophthalmic evaluations.
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Improved developmental outcomes with early intervention.
				- Semi-independent living
				- Vocational skills
				- Better quality of life
			- Life expectancy ~60 years (with modern care).
				- 1983: ~25 years
				- 2024: ~60 years (due to heart surgery, infection control, and holistic care).
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Heart failure (uncorrected defects).
				- Severe intellectual disability.
				- Early-onset Alzheimer’s (~50% by age 50).
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Reduced independence.
	- ### Survival Rates
		- #### With Treatment
			- >80% survive to age 60.
		- #### Without Treatment
			- High infant mortality (untreated cardiac defects).
			- Death in Children due to Heart Defects
			- Death in Adults due to Alzheimer's Disease
