definition:: [[Pre-Eclampsia]] when complicated with grand mal seizures (generalized tonic-clonic convulsions) and/or coma is called eclampsia

- # Management
	- Prediction and Preventions
		- generally, it's preventable in pre-eclampsia but some cases(20-40%) occur without pre-eclamptic state
	- Call for extra help, multiple personel are required to simultaneously manage different aspects
	- Put the patient in bed and prevent falling to prevent injury
	- Put the patient in left lateral recumbent position
	- Tongue blade/mouth gag is placed between the teeth
		- prevent aspiration
		- vomitus and oral secretions removed by frequent suctioning
	- Oxygenation is maintained through a face mask(8-10 L/minute) , Intubate if required
	- Monitor Saturation with Pulse Oximetry : Arterial Blood Gas analysis is needed when $\ce{O2}$ saturation falls below 92%
	- Fluid correction if required, $\ce{NaHCO3}$  if pH<7.1
	- Perform cannulation at both hands to maintain two channels
		- $\ce{MgSO4}$ in one channel
			- Loading Dose : 4-6 g IV slow over 15-20 minute
			- Maintenance Dose : 1-2 g/h IV infusion
		- [[Labetalol]] in another channel
	- Urinary Catheterization
	- Diuretics if pulmonary edema
	- Fluid Balance, if urine output <30 ml/hour
	- Antibiotics to prevent secondary infection
	- Monitor
		- Fetal Status : Heart Rate
		- Magnesium Toxicity
			- Respiratory Rate : >12 breath/min
			- Knee Jerk (Deep Tendon Reflex)
			- Oligouria (normal : >30 ml/hour)
	- Delivery (Obstetric Management of Eclampsia)
		- ((671634c1-4afb-4d67-b1d2-e6166497fa8d))
	- Follow-up and Prognosis
		- follow up for hypertension & proteinuria by 6 weeks time in postnatal clinic
		- if continued then further investiagation and consulation with a physician
