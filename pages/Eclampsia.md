  - ### Stages or Classification #obs-prof-card
    collapsed:: true
    - # Premonitory Stage
      duration:: 30 seconds
      - The patient becomes unconscious.
      - There is twitching of the muscles of the face, tongue and limbs
      - Eyeballs roll or are turned to one side become fixed.
    - # Tonic Stage
      duration:: 30 seconds
      - The whole body goes into a tonic spasm the trunk-opisthotonus, limbs and hands clenched.
      - Respiration ceases and the tongue protrudes between the teetch
      - Cyanosis appears
      - Eyeballs become fixed
    - # Clonic Stage
      duration:: 1-4 minutes
      - All the voluntary muscles undergo alterate contraction and relaxation.
      - The twitchings start in the face then involve one side of the extremities and ultimately the whole body is involved in the convulsion.
      - Biting of the tongue occurs.
      - Breathing is stertorous and blood stained frothy secretions fill the mouth; cyanosis gradually disappears.
    - # Stage of Coma
      - Following the fit, the patient passes on to the stage of coma.
      - It may last for a brief period or in others deep coma persists till another convulsion.
      - On occasion, the patient appears to be in a confused state following the fit and fails to remember the heppenings.
      - Rarely, the coma occurs without prior convulsion

  - ### Clinical Diagnosis
    - #### Classical Presentation
      - Near Term, Term
      - Repeated Convulsions
      - BP raised significantly
      - Urine albumin +++
    - #### Probable Diagnosis
      - nth Gravid at 36 weeks of pregnancy with Eclampsia
  - ### Laboratory Tests

- ## Management and Treatment

  - ### Principle of Management #obGyn-prof-OSPE #18obGyn
    - General nursing Care
    - Control of convuslion : Injection Magnesium Sulphate #obGyn-prof-OSPE
    - Obstetric management
    - Management of complications
  - ### Emergency Management
    collapsed:: true
    - Call for extra help, multiple personel are required to simultaneously manage different aspects
    - Put the patient in bed and prevent falling to prevent injury
    - Put the patient in left lateral recumbent position
    - Tongue blade/mouth gag is placed between the teeth
      - prevent aspiration
      - vomitus and oral secretions removed by frequent suctioning
    - Oxygenation is maintained through a face mask(8-10 L/minute) , Intubate if required
    - Monitor Saturation with Pulse Oximetry : Arterial Blood Gas analysis is needed when $\ce{O2}$ saturation falls below 92%
    - Fluid correction if required, $\ce{NaHCO3}$ if pH<7.1
    - Perform cannulation at both hands to maintain two channels
      - $\ce{MgSO4}$ in one channel
        - Loading Dose : 4-6 g IV slow over 15-20 minute
        - Maintenance Dose : 1-2 g/h IV infusion
      - [[Labetalol]] in another channel (add dosage and all)
    - Urinary Catheterization
    - Diuretics if pulmonary edema
    - Fluid Balance, if urine output <30 ml/hour
    - Antibiotics to prevent secondary infection
    - Monitor

  - ### Drugs
    collapsed:: true
    - Magnesium Sulphate
      - Dosage #obGyn-prof-OSPE
        - Loading Dose : 10 gm
          - 4 gm (8 ml) diluted with 12 ml distilled water slow I/V
          - 3 gm I/M in each buttock (total 6 gm)
        - Maintainance Dose
          - 2.5 gm I/M 4 hourly in alternate buttock for 24 hours from the delivery or last convulsion which ever is last
      - Magnesium Toxicity #obGyn-prof-OSPE
        id:: 671631f9-3f4a-4e5a-9a64-5af96c5b26d0
        - Respiratory Rate : >12 breath/min
        - Knee Jerk (Deep Tendon Reflex)
        - Oligouria (normal : >30 ml/hour)
  - ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
  - ### Follow-up
    - check hypertension & proteinuria by 6 weeks time in postnatal clinic
    - if continued then further investigation and consultation with a [[Primary Care Physician]]
