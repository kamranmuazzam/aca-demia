alias:: Necrotizing Fasciitis of Perineum(Scrotum)
ICD-11_Code::
tags:: disease, general surgery

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
	  *Poly microbial infection involving both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria*
		- [[Escherichia coli]]
		- [[Klebsiella]]
		- [[Streptococcus]]
		- [[Staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[Bacteroides]]
		- [[Clostridium]]
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Diabetes mellitus
		- Immunocompromised states ([[HIV Infection]], [[Chemotherapy]])
		- [[Alcoholism]] or [[Chronic Liver Disease]]
		- Local Trauma or Surgery (e.g., [[Catheterization]], [[Circumcision]] )
		- Obesity
		- Perinial or Genital Infections ([[Abscess]], [[Urethral Stricture]])
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
	- ### Prevalence
		- ### Demographics
			- Sex: Male (7:1 Male to Female Ratio)
			- Age: 50-70 years
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Higher Prevalence in Regions with Limited Access to Healthcare
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Like other necrotizing fasciitis, Fournier's gangrene involves bacterial invasion, toxin release, and tissue necrosis
		- Peculiarity
			- Infection spreads rapidly along fascial planes (Colles' Fascia, Buck's Fascia, and Dartos Fascia)
			- This allows the infection to dissect through tissues without obvious surface signs initially, leading to delayed recognition
			- The scrotum and perineum have a rich blood supply, but thrombosis of small vessels due to bacterial toxins leads to ischemia and necrosis
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Genitourinary system (Scrotum, Penis, Perineum)
		- May extend to the abdominal wall, thighs, or retroperineum
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- Severe Pain and Swelling in Genital or Perineal region
			- Fever, Chills and Systemic Toxicity
			- Foul Smelling Discharge
			- Presence of Risk Factors(Diabetes, Immunosuppression)
		- #### Signs
			- Erythema, edema
			- Signs of Fascial Plain involvement
				- Crepitus
				- Necrotic Skin Changes
					- Blackening
					- Necrotic Patches of Skin
				- Systemic signs of sepsis (tachycardia, hypotension)
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Early Stage
			- Localized Pain and Swelling
		- Advanced Stage
			- Necrosis
			- Systemic Toxicity
			- Organ Failure
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical Diagnosis
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Haematology
			  *Complete Blood Count with CRP*
				- Leukocytosis
				- Elevated CRP
			- Biochemistry
				- Arterial Blood Gas Analysis
					- Metabolic Acidosis
				- Renal Function Test (Creatinine)
				  *Sepsis causing [[AKI]] *
			- Microbiology
				- Wound swab or tissue biopsy for culture and sensitivity
			- Imaging
				- X-ray: To detect subcutaneous gas
				- Ultrasound: To assess scrotal and perineal involvement
				- CT or MRI to assess the extent of tissue involvement
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |Cellulitis|Absence of Necrosis or Systemic Toxicity|
			  |Scrotal Abscess|Localized Infection without fascial involvement|
			  |Testicular Torsion|Acute Scrotal pain without systemic symptoms|
		- ### General Assessment
		  *Evaluation for underlying comorbities*
			- Diabetes
				- Biochemisty
					- [[Random Blood Sugar]]
					- [[HbA1c]]
			- Immunosuppression
				- Immunology Lab
					- CD4 count
					  *if HIV suspected*
					- Immunoglobulin
					  *if immunosuppression suspected*
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Immediate Resuscitation
	  *If onset of sepsis*
		- IV fluids(crystalloids) to maintain hemodynamic stability
		- Correct Electrolyte imbalances and acidosis
	- ### Empirical Antibiotics
		- Broad Spectrum IV antibiotics
		- First line: [[Piperacillin-Tazobactam]] + [[Clindamycin]]
		- Alternative: Meropenem (1g IV every 8 hours) + Vancomycin (15-20 mg/kg IV every 8-12 hours)
		- Duration: Continue for 7-14 days, depending on clinical response
		- Adjusted based on Culture & Sensitivity
	- ### Emergency Surgical Debridement
	  Perform within 6-12 hours of diagnosis
		- Remove all necrotic tissue until healthy, bleeding tissue is seen
		- Leave the wound open for drainage and repeated debridement if needed
	- ### Wound Management
		- Use sterile Dressings or [[Negative Pressure Wound Therapy]]
		- Secondary closure or skin grafting after granulation tissue appears (usually 5-7 days post debridement)
	- ### Adjunctive Therapies
		- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (if availabe) to enhance tissue oxygenation and healing
	- Follow-Up
		- Daily wound assessment and dressing changes
		- Monitor for signs of sepsis or recurrent infection
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Optimize Glycemic Control in Diabetic Patients
		- Encourage smoking Cessation and Weight Management
	- ### Follow-up
		- Monitor wound healing and infection control
		- Address underlying risk factors to prevent recurrence
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Early intervention improves outcomes, but mortality remains high (20-40%)
		- #### Without Treatment
			- Rapid Progression to sepsis, multiorgan failure, and death
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Sepsis, DIC, Acute Kidney Injury
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Chronic Wounds
				- Disfigurement
				- Psychological Impact
	- ### Survival Rates
		- #### With Treatment
			- 60-80% survival with prompt surgical and medical management
		- #### Without Treatment
			- Near 100% mortality
	- ### Quality of Life Considerations
		- Physical and emotional recovery may be prolonged
- ## Prevention
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Health Education
		- Educate high-risk patients about early signs of infection
	- ### Community Approach
