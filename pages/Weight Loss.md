- Clinically significant wight loss - Loss of ≥ 5-10% over preceding 6-12 months
- The probability of uncovering an identifiable cause requiring treatment increases with the quantity and speed of weight loss
- In the absence of clear, objective lifestyle modifications, it is more prudent to assume a person's "clinically significant" weight loss is unintentional until proven otherwise
- Many patients cannot provide an accurate estimate of the degree of weight loss, so always confirm the severity of loss with the medical record(if possible)
- Cachexia
	- Syndrome of weight loss accompanied by loss of muscle mass, fatigue, generalized weakness, and abnormal labs (e.g. anemia, ↓ albumin, ↑ inflammatory markers)
	- Chachexia can occur simultaneously with fluid retention (e.g. leg edema, ascites), obscuring the weight loss.
