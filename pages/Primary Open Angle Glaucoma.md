alias:: Chronic Simple Glaucoma

- Risk Facttors
	- .>50 years
	- family history
- Genes
	- Optineurin
	- WDR 36
	- MYOC
- Pathophysiology
	- resistance in the flow of [[Aqueous Humor]]
	- due to this resistance there is fibrosis
	- trabecular outflow blcoked
	- â†‘ [[IOP]]
	- gradual fibrosis causes very slow painless loss of vision
- Clinical Features
	- Symptoms
		- headache
		- delayed dark adaptation
		- frequent changes in Presbyoptic glasses
	- Signs
		- [[IOP]]
		  .> 21 mm Hg
		  .> 5 mm Hg differences between both eyes
		  .> 8 mm Hg differences in diurnal variation
	- Optic disk changes
		- vertical cupping
		- loss of neuroretinal rim
		- nasalization of blood vessels  in optic disc
		- [[Bayonetting Sign]]
		- Peripapillary atrophy
		- [[Laminar dot Sign]]
	- Visual Field Defects
		- only after 40% axons are damanged
		- Isopter Contraction (earliest sign, but not significant because less specificity)
		- Paracentaral scotoma
			- a spot in the visual field where vision is absent or defiicient
		- Seidel's Scotoma
			- bild spot and paracentaral scotoma merge
		- Arcuate Scotoma
		  alias:: Geram's scotoma
			- Sheidel's Scotoma extends above or below the fixation point to reach the horizontal line
		- Double Arcuate Scotoma
		  alias:: Ring Scotoma
			- Two arcuate scotoma merge
		- Central Scotoma
		- Loss of temporal island of vision
- Management
	- Medical
		- increase outflow
			- PGE2 alpha analogues
				- latanopriost
				- bimatoprost
				- >increase uveioscleral outflow
			- B-Blockers
				- > decrease aquous secreation as receptor present on ciliary process
			- alpha-Agonist
				- Apraclonidine
					- >reduce [[Aqueous Humor]] secretion + increase trabecullar outflow
				- Brimonidine
					- > reduce [[Aqueous Humor]] secretion + increase uveioscleral outflow
				- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
					- Acetazolamide
					- Brinzolamide
					- Dorzolamide
					- > decrease [[Aqueous Humor]] secreation
		- Surgical
			- Laster trabeculoplasty
				- Argon
				- nd: YAG
			- Trabeculectomy
			- Deep sclerectomy
			- SETON surgery
