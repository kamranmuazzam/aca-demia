# Principles of Autoclaving #gs-prof-card
	- At normal atmospheric pressure water boils at 100ºC
	- At this atmospheric pressure temperature of water cannot further raised
	- But if pressure is raised, boiling point of water can also be raised (at 15 lb/sq. Inch pressure, boiling point of water is 121ºC)
	- When steam meets the cooler surface of article, it condenses into a small volume of water & liberates latent heat
	- At the same time condensation of steam into water creates negative pressure that causes rush of more steam to that area & causes more penetration
