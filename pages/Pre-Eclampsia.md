alias:: PE
definition:: Multisystem disorder characterized by denovo onset of HTN with proteinuria developed beyond 20 weeks of gestation or accompanied by neurological, hematological, lymphatic, hepatic, renal manifestations or Fetal growth restriction in absence of proteinuria.

- # Etiology
	- ## Risk Factors
		- Primigravidia
		- Family History: Hypertension, pre-eclampsia
		- Placental abnormalities
			- [[Hyperplacentosis]]
			- Placental ischemia
		- Obesity, Insulin Resistance
		- Pre-existing vascular disease
		- New paternity, pregnancy following ART
		- Thrombophilias
	- ## Causative Factors
		- Failure of trophoblast invasion
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Imbalance of angiogenic and antiangiogenic proteins
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Genetic predisposition
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Aberrant natural immune response to fetus
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Vascular endothelial damage
		- Inflammatory mediators (cytokines)
		- Immunological intolerance between maternal and fetal tissues
			- Coagulation abnormalities
		- Increased oxygen-free radicals
		- Dietary deficiency or excess
- # Diagnosis
	- BP : > 110/90 mm Hg in more than one occasion
	- Either
		- Urine Protein : ++
		- and/or : Evidence of Organ Damage
-
- # Important Investigations
	- 24 hour Urine Protein
	- Opthalmoscopic (in severe cases)
		- Retinal edema
		- Constriction of the arterioles
		- Alteration of normal ratio of veins
		- Hemorrhage
	- Blood values
		- Hematocrit
		- Platelet Count
		- Hepatic Enzymes
		- Serum uric Acid
		- Serum Creatinine
		- Coagulation Profile
	- Antenatal fetal monitoring
		- Daily fetal kick count
		- Ultrasonography for fetal growth and liquor pockets
		- Cardiotocography
		- Umbilical artery flow velocimetry and biophysical profile
- # Management of Pre-eclampsia
	- Rest
		- Admission in hospital is helpful
		- Lying in left-lateral position
	- Diet
		- daily protein : 100g
		- Total calorie: 1600 cal/day
	- Diuretics (if compelling reasons)
		- Cardiac Failure
		- Pulmonary edema
		- Antihypertensive drug therapy induced fluid retention
		- Massive edema
	- Antihypertensives
		- [[Labetalol]]
		- [[Nifedipine]]
		- [[Methyl-dopa]]
		- [[Hydralazine]]
	- If Systolic Blood Pressure > 150 mm Hg
		- Diazepam & phenobarbitone prophylaxis
		- Obstetric Management
			- BP is controlled, wait and continue until term
			- If BP not controlled terminate pregnancy at 37 weeks
				- if, <34 weeks : steroid
			- If chance of delivery within 2 hours, then allow vaginal delivery otherwise [[Cesarian Section]]
