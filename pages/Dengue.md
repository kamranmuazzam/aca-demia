alias:: Dengue Fever, Breakbone Fever  
ICD-11_Code:: 1D24 Dengue  
tags:: disease

- ## Etiology  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Dengue virus (genus *Flavivirus*, family *Flaviviridae*) with four distinct serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, DENV-4)
		- Transmitted primarily through *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* mosquitoes
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Residence or travel to endemic areas (tropical and subtropical regions)
		- Seasonal risk: monsoon/rainy seasons conducive to mosquito breeding
		- Poor water storage/sanitation leading to mosquito breeding sites
		- Previous infection with one serotype increases risk of severe disease with a secondary infection by another serotype (antibody-dependent enhancement)
- ## Epidemiology  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- WHO estimates ~390 million dengue infections annually worldwide, with ~96 million manifesting clinically
		- Incidence increasing due to urbanization, globalization, and climate change
	- ### Prevalence
		- Endemic in >125 countries globally
		- High prevalence in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, Latin America, and Africa
	- ### Demographics
		- Affects all age groups, though severe disease is more common in children in endemic regions and in adults in newly endemic areas
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Endemic in tropical/subtropical climates across Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa, and parts of Oceania
		- Emerging in southern US and Europe due to expanding mosquito ranges
- ## Pathophysiology  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Virus enters via mosquito bite → infects dendritic cells → dissemination to lymph nodes → viremia
		- Host immune response leads to fever and systemic symptoms
		- Secondary infection may trigger antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) → excessive cytokine release → plasma leakage, hemorrhage, shock
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Vascular endothelium (capillary leak syndrome)
		- Hematopoietic system (thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression)
		- Liver (transient hepatitis)
		- Rare CNS involvement (encephalitis, encephalopathy)
- ## Clinical Features  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- Febrile illness with possible progression to Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) or Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS)
	- ### Symptoms
		- Sudden high fever
		- Severe headache
		- Retro-orbital pain
		- Myalgia, arthralgia (“breakbone pain”)
		- Rash (maculopapular, appearing after fever subsides)
		- Nausea, vomiting
	- ### Signs
		- Positive tourniquet test
		- Petechiae, purpura, mucosal bleeding
		- Hepatomegaly
		- Signs of plasma leakage: ascites, pleural effusion, hemoconcentration
		- Hypotension, tachycardia (if shock develops)
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- **Dengue without warning signs** (febrile phase)
		- **Dengue with warning signs** (abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleed, lethargy, rising hematocrit with falling platelets)
		- **Severe Dengue** (plasma leakage leading to shock, severe bleeding, severe organ involvement)
- ## Diagnosis  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical suspicion in endemic/travel-associated febrile illness with above features
		- Laboratory confirmation (NS1 antigen, RT-PCR, IgM/IgG serology)
	- ### Investigation
		- CBC (hemoconcentration, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia)
		- LFTs (transaminase rise)
		- Coagulation profile
		- Chest X-ray/ultrasound to detect effusions or ascites
	- ### Establishing Diagnosis
		- Detection of dengue virus RNA by RT-PCR (early illness)
		- Detection of NS1 antigen (days 1–5 of illness)
		- Serological evidence (IgM/IgG seroconversion or fourfold rise)
	- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
		- | Differential Diagnosis | Shared Features | Clinical Exclusion | Baseline Workup | Direct Testing |
		  |-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------|
		  | Malaria | Fever, headache | Positive blood smear, parasitemia | Full blood count, smear | Thick/thin smear, RDT |
		  | Typhoid fever | Fever, rash, abdominal pain | Positive cultures | Blood culture | Widal/culture |
		  | Leptospirosis | Fever, myalgia | Conjunctival suffusion, renal/hepatic involvement | LFT/RFT | PCR, serology |
		  | Chikungunya | Fever, rash, joint pain | Persistent arthralgia, less thrombocytopenia | CBC | RT-PCR, serology |
		  | COVID-19 | Fever, headache, myalgia | Respiratory symptoms predominate | CBC | PCR/antigen test |
	- ### General Assessment
		- Vital signs, hydration status, bleeding tendency monitoring
		- Daily hematocrit and platelet counts
- ## Management and Treatment  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- **Supportive care is mainstay**
		- Adequate hydration (oral/IV fluids per WHO guidelines)
		- Antipyretics (paracetamol/acetaminophen). Avoid aspirin/NSAIDs due to bleeding risk
		- Blood component therapy for severe hemorrhage or shock (platelets, plasma)
	- ### Surgical Options
		- No specific surgical intervention; only supportive/rescue procedures (e.g., management of complications like bleeding)
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Adequate fluid intake (oral solutions, fruit juices, soups)
		- Calorie-dense diet, avoid alcohol/hepatotoxic drugs
		- Rest and avoid strenuous activity during recovery
	- ### Follow-up
		- Monitor platelet count, hematocrit, liver function until normalization
		- Re-evaluation for persistent fatigue or complications
- ## Prognosis  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- Most cases self-limiting, recovery within 1–2 weeks
		- Severe dengue can be fatal without prompt management
	- ### With Treatment
		- Mortality <1% with timely diagnosis and proper supportive management
	- ### Without Treatment
		- Mortality up to 20% in severe dengue/dengue shock syndrome
	- ### Possible Complications
		- Hypovolemic shock
		- Massive hemorrhage
		- Multi-organ dysfunction (hepatic failure, myocarditis, encephalopathy)
	- ### Long-Term Effects
		- Post-viral fatigue, depression, hair loss (temporary)
		- No chronic carrier state
	- ### Survival Rates
		- **With treatment**: >99% survival
		- **Without treatment**: variable (10–20% mortality in severe cases)
	- ### Quality of Life Considerations
		- Temporary impairment due to prolonged fatigue
		- Psychosocial impact due to recurrent outbreaks in endemic zones
- ## Prevention  
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Health Education

		- Remove stagnant water around households
	- ### Community Approach
		- Vector control programs: insecticide spraying, larvicide, community clean-up campaigns
		- Integrated vector management in urban areas
	- ### Screening Programs
		- Currently no routine population screening; clinical surveillance in endemic/hospital settings
