alias:: DDH
ICD-11_Code:: LB73.0 (Developmental dysplasia of hip)
tags:: #Disease, #[[Developmental Disease]], #Orthopedics

- ## Etiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Causative Agents
		- Multifactorial (genetic, mechanical, hormonal factors)
	- ### Risk Factors
		- Female sex(♀ > ♂, 6:1 ratio)
		- Breech presentation
		- Family history (20-30% risk if first degree relative affected)
		- Oligohydramnios
		- Firstborn child
		- Swaddling with hips extended
- ## Epidemiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Incidence
		- 1-3 per 1000 live births (varies by screening practices)
	- ### Prevalence
		- 60% left hip, 20% right hip, 20% bilateral
		- ### Demographics
			- Higher in Caucasians, Native Americans, and certain European populations
	- ### Geographic Distribution
		- Higher in cultures with traditional swaddling (e.g., Japan, Turkey)
- ## Pathophysiology
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Mechanism of Disease
		- Abnormal hip joint development due to laxity of ligaments, shallow acetabulum or femoral head malposition
	- ### Affected Systems/Organs
		- Musculosckeletal system (hip joint, acetabulum, femur)
- ## Clinical Features
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Presentation
		- #### Symptoms
			- painless in infants; limping or leg-length discrepancy in older children
		- #### Signs
			- Infants
				- Barlow test (dislocatable hip)
				- Ortolani test (reducible hip)
				- Asymmetric thigh folds
				- Limited hip adduction
			- Older children
				- Trendelenburg gait
				- Leg-length discrepancy
	- ### Stages or Classification
		- Graf ultrasound classification (Type I-IV)
			- | **Type** | **Alpha Angle (α)** | **Beta Angle (β)** | **Description** | **Management** |
			  | ---- | ---- | ---- |
			  | **Type I (Normal)** | ≥60° | <55° | Mature acetabulum, well-covered femoral head | No treatment needed |
			  | **Type II (Delayed Ossification)** | 50–59° | 55–77° | Physiologic immaturity (subtypes IIa/b/c) | Follow-up or harness if severe |
			  | **Type III (Decentered Hip)** | <50° | >77° | Femoral head subluxated, acetabular dysplasia | Pavlik harness or closed reduction |
			  | **Type IV (Dislocated Hip)** | Unmeasurable | Unmeasurable | Femoral head dislocated, labrum interposed | Urgent reduction (surgery if late) |
		- Tonnis Classification (Grades 0-4 for dislocation severity)
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
		- Clinical examination + imaging (ultrasound <6 months, X-ray >6 months)
	- ### Investigation
		- ### Establishing Diagnosis
			- Ultrasound (Gold standard < 6 months)
			- X-ray (After ossification of femoral head, ~4-6 months)
		- ### Ruling Out Differential Diagnosis
			- |DD|Ruling Out|
			  |--|--|
			  |Septic arthritis|CRP, joint aspiration|
			  |Cerebral palsy| Neurological exam|
			  |Proximal femoral focal deficiency | X-ray/MRI|
		- ### General Assessment
			- Newborn screening (clinical + selective ultrasound)
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Medical Treatment
		- Pavlik harness (for infants < 6 months, 90% success rate)
			- **Minimum 6 weeks** (for stable hips).
			- **Up to 12 weeks** (for severe cases).
		- Closed reduction + spica casting (if harness fails)
	- ### Surgical Options
		- Open reduction (for irreducible hips)
		- Pelvic/femoral osteotomy (older children)
	- ### Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations
		- Avoid swaddling with hips extended
	- ### Follow-up
		- Regular imaging until skeletal maturity
- ## Prognosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Expected Course
		- #### With Treatment
			- Excellent if detected early (90% normal function)
		- #### Without Treatment
			- ##### Possible Complications
				- Osteoarthritis
				- Avascular necrosis
				- Leg-length discrepancy
			- ##### Long-Term Effects
				- Chronic pain
				- disability
- ## Prevention
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Health Education
		- Teach safe swaddling (hips flexed, abducted)
	- ### Screening Programs
		- Universal clinical screening + selective ultrasound
- ## Patient Education and Support
