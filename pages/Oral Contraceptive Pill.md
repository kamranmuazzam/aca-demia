- # Mode of Action #gyn-prof-card
  collapsed:: true
	- ## Inhibition of Follicular Development
		- Estrogen supresses the secretion of FSH from anterior pituitary
		- without FSH there is no Follicular Development
	- ## Inhibition of Ovulation
		- Progestin supresses the secretion of LH
		- without LH surge there is no ovulation
	- ## Endometrial Changes (Static Endometrial Hypoplasia)
		- Following changes are inhibited by the hormones, edema, decidualization of stroma, and regression of endometrial glands
		- The endometrium becomes thin and inactive, creating and unfavorable environment
	- ## Alteration of cervical mucus
		- Progestin thicken the cervical mucus, making it viscid, scanty and less permeable
		- This physical barrier that impedes sperm penetration and transport through the cervical canal, further reducing the likelihood of fertilization.
	- ## Interference with Tubal Motility and Transport
		- Hormonal contraceptives may affect the motility and function of the fallopian tubes, altering the transport of both sperm and ova.
		- Even in the rare event of breakthrough ovulation, this mechanism, along with the others, reduces the chances of fertilization and subsequent pregnancy.
