			- Inspection
				- Deformity
				- Swelling
				- Ecchymosis
				- Open wound with fracture seen
			- Palpation
				- Tenderness localized to fracture site (check if no significant pain)
				- Instability
				- Painful range of motion if near a joint (a diaphysial joint fracture still might lead to painful range of motion)
				- Impaired pulse (if vascular compromise)
			- Detailed neurological exam
				- Sensation
					- Light Touch
					- 2 point discrimination
				- Reflexes, muscle tone
				- Motor exam
					- Grade strength 1-5
		- #### Imaging
			- Plain radiographs often sufficient
				- At least 2 orthogonal views (AP, Lateral)
				- Joint above and joint below (proximal & distal)
			- CT scan in some instances
				- For better assessing articular fractures
				- For pre-operative planning purposes
				- For Pelvic, Scapular, Spine fracture
			- MRI on nuclear imaging for occult fractures
