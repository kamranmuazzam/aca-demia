	- ### Diagnostic Criteria
- ## Diagnosis
  background-color:: blue
	- ### Clinical Diagnosis
		- #### Classical Presentation same as Clinical Presentation
		- #### Probable Diagnosis
	- ### Evaluation #ortho-prof-written
		- #### History
			- {{embed ((fbf7aec0-e837-41a5-ab98-07614c74239f))}}
		- #### Physical Examination
			- Inspection
				- Deformity
				- Swelling
				- Ecchymosis
				- Open wound with fracture seen
			- Palpation
				- Tenderness localized to fracture site (check if no significant pain)
				- Instability
				- Painful range of motion if near a joint (a diaphysial joint fracture still might lead to painful range of motion)
				- Impaired pulse (if vascular compromise)
			- Detailed neurological exam
				- Sensation
					- Light Touch
					- 2 point discrimination
				- Reflexes, muscle tone
				- Motor exam
					- Grade strength 1-5
		- #### Imaging
			- Plain radiographs often sufficient
				- At least orthogonal views (AP, Lateral)
				- Joint above and joint below (proximal & distal)
			- CT scan in some instances
				- For better assessing articular fractures
				- For pre-operative planning purposes
				- For Pelvic, Scapular, Spine fracture
			- MRI on nuclear imaging for occult fractures
	- ### Differential Diagnosis
		- [[Dislocation]]

		- [[Infection]]
		- [[Sprain]]
		- [[Bone Tumors]]
	- ### Confirmation of Diagnosis
- ## Management and Treatment
  background-color:: blue
	- Bone Heals itself by *regenerating* new bone tissue rather than healing with scar tissue
	- We can assist it in optimizing
		- Fracture alignment ("reduction")
		- Articular alignment
		- Length
		- Rotation
		- Local Environment
	- ### Treatment Options
		- Closed Reduction and Casting
		- ORIF (plate/screw fixation)
		- External Fixation
		- Intramedullary nailing/rodding
		- Arthroplasty (replacement)
	- ### Principle of Management of Long Bone Fracture #ortho-prof-written
		- Reduce
		- Rest and Recognition
			- RICE therapy
		- Reduction
			- [[Open Reduction]]
			- [[Closed Reduction]]
