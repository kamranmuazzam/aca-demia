- Leads
	- Central Terminal
		- This is the virtual negative lead made by combining all the 3 limb leads
		- aVR + aVL + aVF = 0
	- "a" stands for augmented
		- previously the voltages were amplified using resistors, now done by a microprocessor
	- "V" is listed in any lead that uses the central terminal
- Hexaxial System
