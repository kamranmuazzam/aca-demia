- **Limited or No Significant Cognitive Benefit:**
	- **Donepezil and Rivastigmine:** Showed limited or no significant cognitive benefits in clinical trials.
	- **Piracetam:** Did not significantly improve cognitive performance.
	- **Basmisanil:** Did not show significant impact on cognition or adaptive behavior.
	- **ELND005:** Showed an acceptable safety profile but no significant cognitive or behavioral improvements.
- **Some Positive Effects/Mixed Results:**
	- **Folinic Acid:** Showed some improvement in developmental age in young children.
	- **Memantine:** Had mixed results in trials.
	- **EGCG (Epigallocatechin Gallate):** Particularly with cognitive training, showed some positive effects on memory and adaptive behavior.
- **Preclinical Findings (Mouse Models):**
	- Studies in mouse models (Ts65Dn) explored targeting various systems like Aβ protein, serotonin, GABA, DYRK1a protein, and NMDA receptors, with some promising results, especially with early interventions.
- *The outcomes are based on human trials.*
