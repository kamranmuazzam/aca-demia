- Part of Hepatobiliary System
- Largest gland of the body
- Second Largest Organ of the Body
- Mixed Gland(Exocrine & Endocrine)
- # Function
	- Synthesis
	- Endocrine : plasma protein except Ig, and heparin
	- Exocrine : bile
	- Metabolism of CHO(Glycogenesis, Gluconeogenesis), Protein, Fat
	- Storage: Glucose in form of Glycogen, Lipid, Fat Soluble Vitamins(ADEK), also minerals(Fe, Cu)
	- Detoxification of Drugs & Toxins
	- Haemopoietic Function in Fetal Life
- Shape : Wedge shape
- Location
	- Right hypochondriac
	- Epi Gastric (upto left midclavicular line)
	  *Does not go the left hypochonrium*
- Weight (1/36th of body weight)
	- male: 1.4-1.8 kg
	- female: 1.2-1.4kg
	- newborn : 150g
- Support
	- Hepatic veins support the liver (Inferior Vena cava)
	- Intra abdominal pressure
	- Ligaments of the Liver
- Characteristics
	- Highly vascular
	- Moves along with diaphragm
	- Reddish brown, flesh body
	- Essential for life
	- Friable
	- Rapid mitosis
		- partial hepatotectomy | When part of liver is surgically exercised, it can regenerate, max 2/3rd can be removed
		- Hepatocytes are stable cells can go under mitosis when required
- # Macro-Anatomy
	- ## Surfaces
		- There are 5 surfaces, namely superior, right lateral, anterior, posterior and inferior surface
		- ## Superior Surface
		  collapsed:: true
			- shape: convexo-concavo-convex
			- ### Relation
			  collapsed:: true
				- Diaphgram above the entire surface
				- right convex : right lung, right pleura
				- middle concave : heart & pericardium
				- left convex : left lung, pleura, heart with covering pericardium(in the center
		- ## Right Lateral Surface
		  collapsed:: true
			- shape: convex
			- ### Relation
			  collapsed:: true
				- Entire Surface is related to diaphgram
				- If divided into 3 parts (in mid-axillay line)
				  collapsed:: true
					- |part|viscera|ribs|
					  |--|--|--|
					  |upper third|diaphragm, lower border of the right lung, pleural sac|7-8 ribs in mid-axillary line|
					  |middle third|diaphragm, costodiaphragmatic recess of pleura|9-10 ribs in mid-axillary line|
					  |lower third|diaphragm, lungs, no pleura|10-11 ribs in mid-axillary line|
				- Liver sample collected from: 9th or 10th intercostal space (9th intercostal space)
				  collapsed:: true
				  *not in 10th because less mass of liver*
					- Liver sample is collected after forceful expiration because with lung elastic recoil, diaphragm moves up
		- ## Anterior Surface
		  collapsed:: true
			- shape: Triangular
			- ligament fissure of falciform ligament divides the liver into right and left lobe
			- ### Relation
			  collapsed:: true
				- the entire surface is related to diaphragm
				- in the right
				  collapsed:: true
					- right lung, right pleura
					- costal margin on the right side(6-10 ribs+costal cartilage)
				- midline: xiphoid process
				- in the left
				  collapsed:: true
					- left lung, left peura
					- left 7,0 costal cartilage
		- ## Posterior Surface
		  collapsed:: true
			- in between posterior superior border and posterior inferior border
			- ### The Bare Area
			  collapsed:: true
				- its a big area devoid of peritoneum
				- shape: triangular in shape
				  collapsed:: true
					- apex: attachment of right triangular ligament
					- base: right margin for groove for inferior vena cava
					- superior limit: attachment of superior layer of coronary ligament
					- inferior limit: attachment of inferior layer of coronary ligament
				- porto-systemic
		- ## Inferior Surface
