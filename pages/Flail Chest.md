- Pattern of chest movement : Paradoxical movement, moves inwards during inspiration & outwards during expiration
- # Pathophysiology
	- Segmental fracture of the multiple adjacent ribs causing independent segment of chest wall
	- It moves paradoxically (moves inwards during inspiration)
	- The net result, less exchange of gases & less oxygenation of blood
	- End result is hypoxemia & hypercapnea
- # Principles of Treatment
	- ABC

	- Fixed the flail segment of chest by the thick strong leucoplast to prevent temporarily inward & outward movement

	- Then patient is transfer to ICU/ HDU

	- If oxygen saturation is not maintained in ICU then endotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation

	- If patient is unstable then s/he should not be sent for any kind of investigation or operation
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- If become stable after resuscitation then can be immediately sent to operation
